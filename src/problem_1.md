LeetCode Problem 1 is titled "Two Sum". The problem statement is as follows:

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

### Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `-109 <= target <= 109`
- Only one valid answer exists.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The objective of the "Two Sum" problem is finding two different indices in the array such that the numbers at those indices sum up to a specified target value. The constraints are clear about the range of input values and the length of the input array. It is noted that there will be exactly one solution; there cannot be no solution or multiple solutions, which simplifies our approach since we can stop our search as soon as we find a valid pair.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

We can approach the "Two Sum" problem using several strategies:

1. **Brute Force Method:**
   The simplest method involves two nested loops: The outer loop iterates over each element, and the inner loop checks every other element to see if it, when added to the first element, equals the target. This is not efficient for large arrays but it is simple and works well for small inputs.

2. **Using a Hash Map:**
   A more efficient approach is to use a hash map (in Python, a dictionary) to store the difference between the target and the current element, along with the current index. As we iterate through the array, we check if the current element is a key in the hash map. If it is, it means we've found a pair where the current element and the element at the index stored in the hash map sum to the target.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's discuss the hash map approach in detail, as it offers a good balance of efficiency and complexity.

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    lookup = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if num in lookup:
            return [lookup[num], i]  # We found the pair
        lookup[target - num] = i  # Store the index of the required complement
```

Here's how the code works:

- We create an empty dictionary called `lookup`.
- We use the `enumerate` function to iterate over `nums`. This gives us both the index (`i`) and the value (`num`) for each element in the array.
- Within the loop, we ask if `num` is a key in the `lookup` dictionary. If it is, it means we have previously stored a value that, when added to `num`, equals the target. So we return the pair of indices.
- If `num` is not in the lookup, we find the complement (i.e., `target - num`) and store it in the lookup with its corresponding index `i`. This way, when we encounter the complement later on in the array, we'll be able to return it as a result.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's apply our `twoSum` function to the examples given:

```python
print(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))  # Output: [0, 1]
print(twoSum([3, 2, 4], 6))        # Output: [1, 2]
print(twoSum([3, 3], 6))           # Output: [0, 1]
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** The hash map approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `nums` array. This is because we traverse the list containing n elements only once. Each lookup in the table costs only O(1) time on average.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, we need to insert n elements into the hash map.

### Real-World Applications:

The concept applied in solving the "Two Sum" problem can be used in financial calculations (such as finding two transactions that combine to a certain total), inventory systems, or matching paired items in data analysis and data correlation scenarios.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Forgetting to handle edge cases where the same element might be used twice.
- Not considering negative numbers or zero.
- Assuming the input array is sorted.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

The "Two Sum" problem is an example of using hash tables for efficient lookups to avoid the O(n^2) time complexity that the brute-force solution would have. This pattern is common in problems where a complement or pair needs to be identified quickly without multiple iterations over the input data.
