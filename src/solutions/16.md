LeetCode Problem 16 is titled "3Sum Closest". This is a classic problem in algorithm design and coding interviews, often used to test the understanding of two-pointer techniques and array manipulation.

**Problem Statement:**

Given an array `nums` of `n` integers and an integer `target`, you need to find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Problem Analysis:**

- You are given an array of integers and a target sum.
- The array may contain both positive and negative integers.
- The goal is not necessarily to find the exact sum that equals the target but rather to find a sum closest to the target.
- Only three integers from the array can be used to achieve this sum.
- It is guaranteed that there will be one unique solution for each input provided.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], target = 1
Output: 2
```
The closest sum to the target `1` from the provided array can be achieved by summing `[-1, 2, 1]` which equals `2`.

**Solution Rationale:**

The brute force approach would be to check every possible combination of three numbers in the array, calculate their sum, and compare the sums to the target. This would require three nested loops and thus would have a time complexity of O(n^3), which is not efficient, especially for large arrays.

A better approach is to use two-pointers after sorting the array:
1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.
2. Initialize a variable to track the closest sum found so far.
3. Use a loop to iterate over the array for the first element of the triplet.
4. For each element, set two pointers: one pointing at the next element, the other at the last element of the array.
5. Until the two pointers meet, do the following:
   - Calculate the sum of the three current elements.
   - Update the closest sum if the current sum is closer to the target.
   - If the current sum is equal to the target, return the sum (since it cannot get any closer).
   - If the current sum is less than the target, move the lower pointer up to increase the sum.
   - If the current sum is greater than the target, move the upper pointer down to decrease the sum.
6. Repeat the above steps for all elements.

By sorting the array, we can take advantage of the sorted order to move pointers in a directed manner to find sums that are closer to the target, thus optimizing our solution to run in O(n^2).
