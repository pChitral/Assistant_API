LeetCode Problem #113 is titled "Path Sum II". This problem focuses on finding all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree where each path's sum equals a given target sum.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

Here is a deeper analysis of the problem statement:
- You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.
- A path in a tree is a sequence of nodes where there is a connection between any two adjacent nodes in the sequence.
- A root-to-leaf path is a path starting at the root of the tree and ending at a leaf node (a node that has no children).
- Your objective is to find all such paths where the sum of the values along the path equals a given integer target sum.
- The solution should return these paths as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a valid path, and the values are in the order they are encountered on the path from root to leaf.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, we can use a recursive depth-first search (DFS) strategy. This involves traversing the tree by going as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking. DFS is particularly suitable for this problem because it naturally follows a path from the root to a leaf. Here's a general outline of the steps you would take:

1. Perform a DFS starting from the root node, keeping track of the current path you're on and the sum of the values in that path.
2. As you traverse the tree, for each node, add its value to the current path sum.
3. If a leaf node is encountered (no children), check if the current path sum equals the target sum. If it does, save the current path as a valid answer.
4. If a leaf node is not encountered or the sum does not match, backtrack and try other paths.
5. Do this recursively until all paths are checked.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

I will now write the corresponding Python code to solve the problem and then break it down line by line.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def pathSum(self, root: TreeNode, targetSum: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        def dfs(node, curr_sum, path):
            if not node:
                return
            
            # Include current node's value in the path and update the sum
            curr_sum += node.val
            path.append(node.val)
            
            # Check if the current node is a leaf and sum equals target sum
            if not node.left and not node.right and curr_sum == targetSum:
                paths.append(list(path))
            else:
                # If not leaf, continue DFS on child nodes
                dfs(node.left, curr_sum, path)
                dfs(node.right, curr_sum, path)
            
            # Backtrack to explore other paths
            path.pop()
        
        paths = []
        dfs(root, 0, [])
        return paths
```

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

- `TreeNode` class definition: A standard definition for a binary tree node object with `val`, `left`, and `right` attributes.
- `Solution` class with `pathSum` method: Takes a `TreeNode` representing the root of the binary tree and an integer `targetSum`.
- Inside `pathSum`, we define a nested `dfs` helper function for depth-first search. This method takes three parameters: `node` (current node), `curr_sum` (sum of values in the current path), and `path` (list of values from root to the current node).
- If the `node` is `None`, it means we have hit a dead end, so we return without doing anything.
- We add the `node`'s value to both `curr_sum` and `path`.
- If the `node` is a leaf (`not node.left and not node.right`) and `curr_sum` equals `targetSum`, we append a copy of `path` to the `paths` list as a valid solution.
- If the `node` is not a leaf, we recursively call `dfs` on both the left and right children of `node`, passing the current state of `curr_sum` and the `path`.
- We perform a `path.pop()` to backtrack and remove the last inserted node value, allowing us to try alternate paths after returning from the recursive call.
- `paths` is defined as a list that will store the found paths and initialized before starting the DFS.
- We start the DFS with a call to `dfs(root, 0, [])`, passing in the root node, a sum of `0` since we are at the start of a path, and an empty list for `path`.
- The `pathSum` function then returns the `paths` list as the result.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's consider the following binary tree and assume the target sum is 22:

```
    5
   / \
  4   8
 /   / \
11  13  4
/ \     / \
7  2   5   1
```

The recursion will explore paths `[5, 4, 11, 7]`, `[5, 4, 11, 2]`, `[5, 8, 13]`, and `[5, 8, 4, 5]`, `[5, 8, 4, 1]`. Among these, the paths that sum to 22 are `[5, 4, 11, 2]` and `[5, 8, 4, 5]`. These would be the correct output.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: Each node in the tree is visited once, which gives us O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity depends on the height of the tree due to the call stack during recursion and can be O(log N) in the best case (balanced tree) and O(N) in the worst case (completely unbalanced tree). Additionally, space is needed to store the valid paths, which can potentially be O(NlogN) if every path is equal to the target sum (every leaf node results in a path that needs to be recorded).

### Real-World Applications:

This algorithm could be used in computing where you may have a hierarchical structure representing decisions with associated costs, and you would like to find all sequences of decisions that lead to a particular budget.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- **Backtracking**: It is essential to remember to "undo" the last step when recursion returns. This is what `path.pop()` does in the code.
- **List Copying**: When you find a valid path, you need to append a copy of it to the list of paths (`paths.append(list(path))`), or else subsequent modifications to the path will affect the stored paths.
- **Edge Cases**: Including checks for None nodes and confirming that a node is a leaf are crucial to prevent invalid paths or crashes due to null references.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem is a typical example of a tree-based DFS with backtracking. Recognizing DFS patterns is useful in a wide range of problems that involve exploring all possibilities or searching for particular configurations in a state space, like combinatorial problems, puzzles, and game playing algorithms.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:

Related problems that involve tree traversal or a similar DFS-based approach include:
- LeetCode #112: "Path Sum" (simpler variant of this problem, where you just need to find if there exists at least one such path)
- LeetCode #437: "Path Sum III" (finds the number of paths that sum to a given value)
- LeetCode #129: "Sum Root to Leaf Numbers" (sums the numbers represented by the root-to-leaf paths)
- LeetCode #98: "Validate Binary Search Tree" (a different tree traversal problem where you're checking a property of the tree rather than finding paths)

Each of these problems reinforces the understanding of DFS traversal in trees and the subtle variations in using additional data structures or modifying the traversal logic based on the specific requirements.
