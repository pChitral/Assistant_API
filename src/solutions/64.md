LeetCode problem number 64 is titled "Minimum Path Sum," and it falls under the category of dynamic programming problems. Let's break down the problem statement and analyze every aspect of it before discussing solutions.

### Problem Statement:

Given a `m x n` grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from the top left to the bottom right which minimizes the sum of all the numbers along its path.

#### Constraints:

1. You can only move either down or right at any point in time.
2. The number of rows `m` and columns `n` will be in the range [1, 200].
3. Each cell has a non-negative integer value.

### Problem Analysis:

This is a classic dynamic programming (DP) problem where we want to find the minimum cost path in a 2D matrix. The constraints mean that we have limited movement options – we can only move to the right or down, which significantly reduces the number of paths we need to consider.

### Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, we'll use dynamic programming to build up a solution by solving smaller subproblems. We can create a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum path sum to reach the cell at `(i, j)` from the top left corner. The minimum path sum at `dp[i][j]` would then be the minimum of either `dp[i-1][j]` or `dp[i][j-1]` plus the value at grid cell `(i, j)`.

For the boundary cells (first row and first column), we can only move from the left or the top, respectively. Therefore, the DP table is filled straightforwardly for these cells by cumulative sums.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

```python
def minPathSum(grid):
    if not grid:
        return 0
    
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
    
    # Initialize first row
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[0][i] = dp[0][i - 1] + grid[0][i]
    
    # Initialize first column
    for j in range(1, m):
        dp[j][0] = dp[j - 1][0] + grid[j][0]
        
    # Fill out the DP table
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + grid[i][j]
    
    # The bottom-right cell contains the answer
    return dp[-1][-1]
```

Let's break it down:
- We start by handling the edge case where `grid` might be empty.
- Determine the dimensions `m` and `n` of the grid.
- Create a 2D list `dp` of the same dimensions to store the minimum path sums.
- Initialize the top-left value `dp[0][0]` since it's where we start.
- Fill the first row and first column separately as there is only one way to reach those cells.
- For the rest of the cells, calculate the `dp[i][j]` value by taking the minimum of the cell to the left (`dp[i][j-1]`) and the cell above (`dp[i-1][j]`) then adding the grid value `grid[i][j]`.
- After populating the whole DP table, the answer is the value in the bottom-right cell `dp[-1][-1]`.

### Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: We iterate through each cell in the grid exactly once. Thus, the time complexity is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid.
- Space Complexity: We allocate a 2D list of the same size as the grid, which gives us a space complexity of `O(m * n)`.

### Examples:

1. If the grid is:
   ```
   [1,3,1]
   [1,5,1]
   [4,2,1]
   ```
   The minimum path sum is `7` because `1→3→1→1→1→1` is the path that gives us the minimum sum.

2. If the grid is:
   ```
   [1,2,5]
   [3,2,1]
   ```
   The minimum path sum is `6` because `1→2→2→1` is the path that gives us the minimum sum.

### Real-World Applications:

This problem is applicable in various scenarios where you need to find optimal paths or routes given constraints, such as GPS navigation systems, pathfinding in robotics, and optimizing network traffic routing.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

When solving dynamic programming problems, some common pitfalls include:
- Not initializing the base cases correctly.
- Overlooking the boundary conditions.
- Trying to optimize prematurely, leading to overly complicated code.

For this particular DP problem, it's important to handle the first row and column correctly since they set the stage for calculating the rest of the DP table.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem is a classical example of dynamic programming, where we solve the problem by combining the solutions to subproblems. Recognizing that the problem asks for an optimal substructure and has overlapping subproblems, dynamic programming is an ideal strategy. It follows the pattern that the optimal solution to the entire problem depends on the optimal solutions to its subproblems.
