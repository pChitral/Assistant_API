LeetCode Problem 22 is titled "Generate Parentheses". Here's an extensive breakdown of the problem:

## Problem Statement

Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

To be more precise, you need to generate all possible strings of length 2 * n, where 'n' is the number of pairs of parentheses, and each string must be a valid parentheses sequence.

For example,
If n = 3, the function should generate the following list:
```
[
  "((()))",
  "(()())",
  "(())()",
  "()(())",
  "()()()"
]
```
Each combination must consist of n opening '(' parentheses and n closing ')' parentheses, and must be a valid parentheses expression.

## In-Depth Solution Rationale

The problem of generating well-formed parentheses sequences is a classic example of a recursive problem that can also be approached using backtracking.

### Recursive Approach:
1. Each recursive call is responsible for placing either an opening '(' or a closing ')' parenthesis.
2. The base case is when the number of placed opening and closing parentheses both equal n. At this point, a well-formed parentheses sequence has been generated, and it can be added to the results.
3. The recursive calls must maintain the property of placing a closing parenthesis only if there are opening ones that have not been closed yet.

### Backtracking Approach:
1. Similar to the recursive approach, we try to extend the current parentheses sequence by adding either an opening or a closing parenthesis, with the goal of constructing a valid sequence.
2. We keep track of the number of opening and closing parentheses placed so far.
3. If the number of opening parentheses is less than `n`, we can put an additional `'('`. If the number of closing parentheses is less than the number of opening parentheses, we can put an additional `')'`.
4. On reaching a length of 2 * n, we found a valid combination, so we add it to the answer list.

The critical part of the backtracking approach is knowing when to add an opening or closing parenthesis. We must ensure that at no point do we add a closing parenthesis if there aren’t enough opening parentheses to match it—this would lead to an invalid sequence.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation

Here's how we can implement the backtracking approach in Python:

```python
def generateParenthesis(n):
    def backtrack(S='', left=0, right=0):
        if len(S) == 2 * n:
            # The parentheses string is complete.
            ans.append(S)
            return
        if left < n:
            # We can place an opening parenthesis.
            backtrack(S + '(', left+1, right)
        if right < left:
            # We can place a closing parenthesis.
            backtrack(S + ')', left, right+1)

    ans = []
    backtrack()
    return ans
```

Let's break it down:

- `generateParenthesis` is the main function that a user calls with the number of pairs `n`.
- Inside `generateParenthesis`, we define a nested helper function `backtrack`, which takes three parameters: `S` (the current string of parentheses), `left` (the current number of opening parentheses), and `right` (the current number of closing parentheses).
- We initialize our backtracking with an empty string and equal number of left and right parentheses (both set to 0).
- If `S` reaches the length of 2 * `n`, it means we have a complete well-formed parentheses string, so we add it to the answer list `ans`.
- We then check if we can add an opening parenthesis. We can do that if the number of left parentheses is less than `n`.
- Similarly, we can add a closing parenthesis if the number of right parentheses is less than the number of left parentheses, thus maintaining the validity of the sequence.
- `ans` list collects all the valid combinations that are generated via recursive backtracking.

## Elaborate Examples

Let's run through a couple of examples to illustrate how this works:

For `n = 2`, the call stack would look like:

```
backtrack(S='', left=0, right=0)
    -> backtrack(S='(', left=1, right=0)
        -> backtrack(S='((', left=2, right=0)
            -> backtrack(S='(()', left=2, right=1)
                -> backtrack(S='(())', left=2, right=2)  # Add to ans
        -> backtrack(S='()', left=1, right=1)
            -> backtrack(S='()(', left=2, right=1)
                -> backtrack(S='()()', left=2, right=2)  # Add to ans
```

The `ans` list would end up with `["(())", "()()"]`.

## Thorough Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(4^n / sqrt(n)). It's the nth Catalan number, which arises naturally in various counting problems, like counting the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched. The proof for this lies in combinatorial mathematics.

- Space Complexity: O(n). Space is used to store the recursion stack. While generating one sequence, the maximum depth of the recursive call stack is n (not considering the space used to store the output itself).


## Real-World Applications

This problem has real-world significance in validating and generating expressions in programming languages, mathematical expressions, and sequences of nested structures (like JSON or XML), where the proper opening and closing of entities is crucial for the integrity of the data.

## Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- It's easy to mistakenly try to use a simple iterative approach, but correct generation requires recursive construction or a proper understanding of backtracking.
- One might also forget to enforce the rules that govern the valid placement of parentheses, thus generating invalid expressions.

## Problem Pattern Identification

This problem illustrates a combination of recursion, backtracking, and the generation of combinatorial objects – a common pattern for problems involving permutations, combinations, and bracketing.
