LeetCode problem number 15 is known as "3Sum." This problem is a classic example of using two-pointer technique within array processing to identify a set of three integers from an array that sum up to zero.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem statement for "3Sum" is as follows:

Given an array `nums` of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in `nums` such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. **Sorting**: First, sort the input array `nums`. Sorting helps us skip duplicate elements efficiently and use the two-pointer technique.

2. **Iterating with Two Pointers**: For each element in the array, we use a two-pointer approach to find the remaining two elements that sum to zero. We set a low pointer just after the current element, and a high pointer at the end of the array. We calculate the sum of current, low, and high elements to check if they add up to zero.

3. **Moving Pointers**: If we find a sum that is too low (less than zero), we move the low pointer to the right to increase the sum. If the sum is too high (more than zero), we move the high pointer to the left to decrease the sum.

4. **Avoiding Duplicates**: After finding each valid triplet, skip all the duplicate values by moving the low and high pointers to their next different values.

5. **Early Stopping**: If the current element is greater than zero, we can stop the iteration early because it's not possible to have three positive numbers add up to zero.

6. **Unique Triplets**: Ensure that the indices of "a, b, c" are not the same and the triplet does not already exist in our solution set to maintain uniqueness.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's go through the Python code step by step:

```python
def threeSum(nums):
    nums.sort()  # Sort the array
    result = []  # Initialize the result list
    
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # Skip the duplicate elements
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
            continue
        
        # Two pointers, left and right
        left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
            
            if total < 0:
                left += 1  # Move the left pointer to the right
            elif total > 0:
                right -= 1  # Move the right pointer to the left
            else:
                # Found a triplet
                result.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])
                # Skip duplicates for the left and right pointers
                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]:
                    left += 1
                while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right - 1]:
                    right -= 1
                # Move both pointers after finding a valid triplet
                left += 1
                right -= 1
                
    return result
```

In the above code, first we sort `nums`. Then we iterate through each element, skip duplicates, and apply the two-pointer technique. We move the `left` and `right` pointers depending on whether the current sum is less than or greater than zero. If the sum is zero, we append the triplet to `result` and move both pointers, while skipping over duplicates.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's use an example to demonstrate the process:

Suppose nums is [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4].

After sorting: [-4, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2]

- We start with `i = 0`, and `nums[i] = -4`. The two-pointer sum needs to be 4, which is impossible because the maximum sum we can get is `1 + 2 = 3`. So we move on.
- At `i = 1`, and `nums[i] = -1`. We skip `i = 2` because it is a duplicate.
- `left` starts at `i + 1 (3)` and `right` starts at the end `5`. We compute the sum as `-1 + 0 + 2 = 1`. Since this is greater than zero, we decrement `right`.
- Now, the sum is `-1 + 0 + 1 = 0`. We have found a triplet and add it to the results. Then, we move `left` and `right` to the next non-duplicate elements.

... and so on until we have iterated through the array.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we have one loop iterating through the array (O(n)) and a nested while loop for the two-pointer scan, which also takes O(n) at most for each fixed element from the outer loop. Sorting the array takes O(n log n), which is dominated by the O(n^2) two-pointer search.

Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) if we ignore the space required for the output. The algorithm only uses a few extra variables for keeping pointers and sum calculations. The sorting operation is in-place.

### Real-World Applications:

This problem can represent any situation where we want to find triplets within a data set that satisfy a specific criteria, such as balancing accounts, matching resources, or even in computer graphics for identifying collinear points.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

Common pitfalls include not handling duplicates correctly, which can lead to non-unique triplets in the result. Another pitfall is not considering the sorted nature of the array when moving pointers, which is essential for optimizing the algorithm.

A valuable trick is to use the continuation condition `if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]` to skip over duplicate elements, because continuing the loop without testing will result in repeated triplets.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

The two-pointer technique used in this problem is a common pattern in problems related to arrays and pair/triplet sum problems. Recognizing this pattern is useful for solving similar problems like "Two Sum," "Container With Most Water," "4Sum," etc.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:

- Problem 1: Two Sum
- Problem 11: Container With Most Water
- Problem 18: 4Sum

Each of these problems requires a similar strategy of moving pointers based on the sum condition, and each has its own quirks that require slight variations in the approach.
