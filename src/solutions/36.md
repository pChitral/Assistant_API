LeetCode Problem 36 is titled "Valid Sudoku". This problem asks you to determine if a given 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of the problem and how to solve it in Python.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The game of Sudoku is played on a 9x9 grid divided into 9 smaller 3x3 subgrids. To solve a Sudoku puzzle, each row, column, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids must contain all of the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once. In the context of this problem, the validation criteria are:

1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3x3 subgrids must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Additionally:
- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid according to the above rules, but it is not necessarily solvable.
- The board that you receive could include the character '.' as a placeholder for empty cells, which can be ignored during validation.
- The input is a list of lists where each sublist represents a row in the Sudoku board.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

A good approach to solving this problem is to perform three checks:
- Check each row for duplicates.
- Check each column for duplicates.
- Check each of the nine 3x3 subgrids for duplicates.

To do this efficiently, you may use hash sets to track the numbers seen in each row, column, and subgrid. As you iterate through the board, you will check if the current number has already been seen in the current row, column, or subgrid. If it has, the Sudoku board is not valid.

For the subgrids, you can calculate the index of the subgrid using the formula:
```
subgrid_index = (row // 3) * 3 + (col // 3)
```
This formula ensures that each 3x3 block gets a unique index from 0 to 8.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Python code to solve this problem:

```python
def isValidSudoku(board):
    rows = [set() for _ in range(9)]
    cols = [set() for _ in range(9)]
    subgrids = [set() for _ in range(9)]

    for row in range(9):
        for col in range(9):
            num = board[row][col]
            if num != '.':
                if num in rows[row] or num in cols[col] or num in subgrids[(row // 3) * 3 + col // 3]:
                    return False
                rows[row].add(num)
                cols[col].add(num)
                subgrids[(row // 3) * 3 + col // 3].add(num)
    return True
```

- `rows`, `cols`, and `subgrids` are lists of sets where each set will hold unique numbers for each row, column, and subgrid, respectively.

- The two nested loops iterate over each cell in the board.

- `num` is the value in the current cell.

- If `num` is not '.', meaning the cell is not empty, we check for duplicates by looking in the respective sets.

- If a duplicate is found (the number is already in a set), `return False` immediately, indicating that the board is invalid.

- If not, the number is added to the respective sets for the row, column, and subgrid.

- After checking all cells, if no duplicates are found, `return True` indicating that the board is valid.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's consider an example board:

```python
board = [
    ["5", "3", ".", ".", "7", ".", ".", ".", "."],
    ["6", ".", ".", "1", "9", "5", ".", ".", "."],
    [".", "9", "8", ".", ".", ".", ".", "6", "."],
    ["8", ".", ".", ".", "6", ".", ".", ".", "3"],
    ["4", ".", ".", "8", ".", "3", ".", ".", "1"],
    ["7", ".", ".", ".", "2", ".", ".", ".", "6"],
    [".", "6", ".", ".", ".", ".", "2", "8", "."],
    [".", ".", ".", "4", "1", "9", ".", ".", "5"],
    [".", ".", ".", ".", "8", ".", ".", "7", "9"]
]
```

Upon running the `isValidSudoku` function with this board, it will return `True` because there are no repeated numbers in any row, column, or subgrid.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

**Time Complexity**: O(1), since we process each of the 81 cells exactly once, and our operation is constant time. Though it may seem like O(n^2) where n is the side length of the grid (9), since 9 is a constant, it simplifies to O(1).

**Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a fixed amount of space to create the sets for rows, columns, and subgrids irrespective of the input size.

### Real-World Applications:

Validating Sudoku puzzles is a straightforward application itself, but the principles used in this problem have broader applications such as:
- Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)
- Optimizations based on set operations or uniqueness constraints.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Remember to skip '.' characters which represent empty cells.
- Minor indexing errors, especially when calculating subgrid indices, can lead to incorrect results.
- Disregarding space complexity. Although the board size is constant, if it wasnâ€™t, using too much extra space could be a concern.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This is a pattern of "Set for Uniqueness Check", often used in problems where you have to check for duplicates or maintain unique elements in a collection.
