LeetCode Problem #79 is titled "Word Search" and it is a medium-difficulty problem that requires depth-first search (DFS) and backtracking to solve. Let's break down the problem and then discuss the solution strategies.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
In this problem, you are given a 2D board of characters and a word. You need to determine if the given word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in constructing the word.

Here are some key points to consider:
- The board will be represented as a list of lists, where each element represents a character.
- A word can be constructed from letters that are contiguous in a straight line—up, down, left, or right—from a given starting point.
- You cannot reuse a single letter position more than once for a given word.
- You need to return a boolean value indicating if it is possible to construct the word on the board.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
The solution to this problem is based on backtracking and DFS. Essentially, the algorithm involves the following steps:
1. Iterate over each cell in the 2D grid.
2. For each cell, if it matches the first character of the word, start a DFS search from that cell.
3. In the DFS, explore the 4 possible directions (up, down, left, right), and for each valid direction, check the next character of the word.
4. If a direction leads to the next character, continue the DFS with the remaining characters of the word, marking the current cell as used.
5. If the current path does not lead to a solution, backtrack and mark the current cell as unused.
6. If all the characters of the word are found in the correct sequence, return True.
7. If the entire board is explored without finding the sequence, return False.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
We will now discuss a Python code solution for this problem in detail. (Please note that while we will discuss a generic solution here, variations might exist based on specific implementation preferences.)

```python
def exist(board, word):
    def dfs(board, word, index, x, y):
        if index == len(word):
            return True
        if x < 0 or x >= len(board) or y < 0 or y >= len(board[0]) or word[index] != board[x][y]:
            return False
        temp, board[x][y] = board[x][y], '/'  # mark as visited
        found = (dfs(board, word, index + 1, x + 1, y) or
                 dfs(board, word, index + 1, x - 1, y) or
                 dfs(board, word, index + 1, x, y + 1) or
                 dfs(board, word, index + 1, x, y - 1))
        board[x][y] = temp  # unmark, backtrack
        return found

    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if dfs(board, word, 0, i, j):
                return True
    return False
```

Line by line explanation:
- The `exist` function is what we will call to determine if the word can be found in the board. It takes two parameters: `board` and `word`.
- The `dfs` function is a helper function that performs the depth-first search. It takes five arguments: the `board`, the `word`, the current `index` in the word, and coordinates (`x`, `y`) indicating the current position on the board.
- The base case for the DFS is when the `index` equals the length of the `word`, which means that every character has been successfully found and matched on the board, thus returning `True`.
- The next lines perform bounds checking and match checking. If we're out of bounds or the current cell doesn't match the word's current character, we return `False`.
- We temporarily mark the current cell as visited by replacing its value with `'/'`, to avoid revisiting it.
- We then explore the 4 possible directions from the current cell by calling the `dfs` function recursively and incrementing the `index`.
- If none of the direction explores successfully, we backtrack by restoring the original cell value.
- We iterate over every cell in the board and call the `dfs` function `if` that cell starts with the first character of the word. If any call to `dfs` returns `True`, we return `True` from the `exist` function.
- If the whole board is checked without success, we return `False`.

### Elaborate Examples
Let's take a look at two examples:

Example 1:
```plaintext
board = [
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]
word = "ABCCED"
```
Here, starting from the top left 'A', the sequence 'ABCCED' can be found by moving right to 'B', down to 'C', right to the next 'C', up to 'E', and left to 'D'. Therefore, `exist(board, word)` should return `True`.

Example 2:
```plaintext
board = [
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]
word = "ABCB"
```
This word cannot be constructed because the letter 'B' would have to be used twice. Therefore, `exist(board, word)` should return `False`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this solution is O(N * 4^L), where N is the number of cells in the board and L is the length of the word. Here's why:
- For each cell, we potentially explore 4 directions in our DFS.
- With each recursive call, the maximum number of directions to explore decreases by one since we mark the current cell as visited.
- However, in the worst case, we might explore all 4 directions for every character in the word.

The space complexity is O(L) due to the call stack during the recursive calls, where L is the length of the word.

### Real-World Applications
Searching for a word in a grid is a simplified version of many real-world problems:
- In word games like Boggle or Scrabble, this algorithm can be used to check for the existence of a word on the board.
- In electronic design automation, similar algorithms can be utilized for pathfinding on a grid representing a circuit board.
- In robotics, pathfinding algorithms like DFS are often applied in navigation and exploration tasks.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks
- Make sure not to revisit already visited cells in the board during the DFS search.
- Handle the base case properly. It's important to check if all characters have been found in the correct sequence.
- Restoring the state after each DFS search (backtracking) is crucial to avoid affecting other potential paths.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem illustrates a classic backtracking and search pattern in which we explore multiple paths to find a solution and backtrack when a path doesn't lead to a solution.
