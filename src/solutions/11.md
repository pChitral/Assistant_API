LeetCode Problem 11 is the "Container With Most Water" problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of the problem and its solution.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

In this problem, you are given an array `height` of integer numbers where each integer represents a point on the coordinate plane and the value represents the height of a vertical line drawn from that point up. The array indices are the horizontal positions of each line.

Your goal is to find two lines that together with the X-axis form a container such that the container contains the most water.

Remember, you can't slant the container and the amount of water contained is the minimum height of the two lines multiplied by the distance between them (or the number of indices between the two lines).

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, one might consider a brute force solution, which is to check every possible pair of lines and calculate the area of the water container they form. However, the brute force approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array, which is not efficient for large arrays.

A more efficient approach is the two-pointer technique, where you initialize two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the array. At each step, you move the pointer pointing at the shorter line towards the other pointer, then calculate and store the area if it is larger than the maximum area found so far. The intuition behind this is that by moving the shorter line inward, there's a possibility of finding a taller line that, when paired with the opposite side's line, might contain a larger area.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Here is a possible Python solution using the two-pointer approach:

```python
def maxArea(height):
    max_water = 0  # Initial maximum water is set to 0
    left = 0  # Pointer to the start of the array
    right = len(height) - 1  # Pointer to the end of the array

    while left < right:
        # Calculate the height and width
        min_height = min(height[left], height[right])
        width = right - left
        # Calculate the area
        area = min_height * width
        
        # Update max_water if the found area is greater
        max_water = max(max_water, area)

        # Move the pointers
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1  # Move left pointer to the right
        else:
            right -= 1  # Move right pointer to the left

    return max_water
```

Let's break it down:

- `max_water`: This variable keeps track of the maximum water container found so far.
- `left` and `right`: These are pointers that start at each end of the array.
- In the `while` loop, we calculate the height of the container as the minimum of the heights of the two lines being pointed to by `left` and `right`, and the width as the distance between them.
- We calculate the `area` and update `max_water` if this `area` is greater than `max_water`.
- Depending on which line is shorter, we increment `left` or decrement `right` and repeat the process.
- We continue this until `left` and `right` meet.
- Finally, we return `max_water`.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's say we have the input array `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`. Initially, `left = 0` and `right = 8`. The area calculated is min(1,7) \* (8-0) = 7. Moving the left pointer: `left = 1` and `right` stays at 8. Now the area is min(8,7) \* (8-1) = 56, which is our new maximum. We will keep repeating this process, updating the maximum water accordingly. In the end, the maximum area of water that can be trapped is 56.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, because we are passing through the array only once with two pointers moving towards each other.

The space complexity is O(1) because we use a constant amount of additional spaceâ€”only variables for the pointers and max water calculation.

### Real-World Applications

This type of problem, while abstract in its formulation, can represent various real-world optimization scenarios. For example, it could be a simplified model for container packing or resource allocation where the height represents limitations on resource capacity, and the width represents the time or distance over which the resources can be utilized.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

A common pitfall for this problem is to assume that the best solution must involve the tallest line in the `height` array. This is not always true as the best solution may involve shorter lines that are farther apart.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem exemplifies a common problem-solving pattern known as the two-pointer technique. Recognizing when to apply this pattern is crucial in solving similar array problems that involve finding a pair of elements that satisfy certain conditions.

Each problem has a variant of finding matches or optima within an array, and the two-pointer technique can be applied effectively in these scenarios.
