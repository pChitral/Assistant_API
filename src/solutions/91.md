### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The problem "Decode Ways" presents a string containing only digits and asks the number of ways it can be decoded to get a list of characters where 'A' to 'Z' correspond to '1' to '26'. The mapping of digits to letters is similar to how text messages were encoded on a numerical keypad in the days before smartphones.

The specific conditions of the problem are as follows:

- The input is a non-empty string only containing digits, and it should not contain any leading zeros.
- We need to count the number of ways to decode it into letters.
- The numbers '1' to '26' map to 'A' to 'Z'.
- The string can have a varying number of digits, so we must consider different lengths and their implications.

An empty string or a string with invalid decoding (like "06" which cannot be decoded because '0' doesn't map to any letter and '06' isn't a valid two-digit number in the encoding) should result in zero, as there is no way to decode it.

Some nuances to consider in this problem are:

- A single '0' can't be decoded by itself; it must be paired with a preceding '1' or '2' to make a valid '10' or '20' decoding.
- Any digit following a '0' must be considered the start of a new valid decoding (if possible).
- Consecutive valid two-digit numbers can be split into one-digit decodings or left as is.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The solution to this problem involves recognizing it as a dynamic programming challenge. Dynamic programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.

A typical approach to solve this problem is to use a bottom-up dynamic programming algorithm:

1. **Initialization:** Create a DP array of size n+1, where n is the length of the input string. The array is initialized such that `DP[0]` is 1 (an empty string has one way to be decoded), and `DP[1]` depends on whether the first character is a zero or not (if it's zero, then there are zero ways; otherwise, there's one way).

2. **State Transition:** To fill in the rest of the DP array, start from the second character and move rightwards:
   - For each index `i`, set `DP[i]` to `DP[i-1]` if the current character is not '0' (since a non-'0' can be decoded on its own).
   - If the two-digit number formed by the current and the previous character falls between 10 and 26 (inclusive), add `DP[i-2]` to `DP[i]`.
   - This addition reflects that a valid two-digit number can be considered a single letter, so it carries the number of ways that were possible until `i-2`.

3. **Result:** After filling in the array, `DP[n]` contains the number of ways to decode the entire string.

Here is a step-by-step example of how the algorithm would work on the input "226":

- `DP[0]` is 1.
- `DP[1]` is 1 because '2' can be decoded as 'B'.
- For `i=2`, '2' can be decoded as 'B', so `DP[2] = DP[1]`.
- Since '22' also can be decoded as 'V', we also add `DP[0]` to `DP[2]`, so `DP[2] = DP[1] + DP[0] = 2`.
- Now, for `i=3`, '6' can be decoded as 'F', so `DP[3] = DP[2]`.
- Since '26' is valid, we add `DP[1]` to `DP[3]`, so `DP[3] = DP[2] + DP[1] = 3`.
