LeetCode Problem #83 is called "Remove Duplicates from Sorted List". This problem falls under the category of linked list manipulation. Let's break down the problem, propose a solution, and go through it in detail.

### Problem Breakdown

Given the head of a sorted linked list, the task is to delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. The function should return the head of the revised linked list.

Here is what the problem explicitly specifies:

- The linked list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The function should modify the list in place, which means it should not create a new list but alter the existing one.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The key to solving this problem lies in capitalizing on the fact that the list is already sorted. This means that any duplicates will be adjacent to each other.

The general strategy is as follows:

1. Traverse the linked list starting from the head node.
2. At each step, check if the current node has the same value as the next node.
3. If they are equal, adjust the links to bypass the duplicate node.
4. Continue this process until the entire list has been traversed.

Here, we favor an iterative approach over recursion for its simplicity and for avoiding the potential stack overflow that could result from recursion if the list is very long.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

The implementation in Python would look something like this:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def deleteDuplicates(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    current = head
    while current and current.next:
        if current.val == current.next.val:
            current.next = current.next.next
        else:
            current = current.next
    return head
```

Let's break this down line by line:

- The `ListNode` class is the definition of a node in the linked list.
- `deleteDuplicates` is the function we are to implement, which accepts the `head` of the linked list.
- Inside the function, we define a variable `current` that will be used to traverse the list. Initially, it's set to the `head`.
- The `while` loop is the core of the algorithm. It will continue as long as `current` and `current.next` are not `None`. The latter condition is essential to avoid a `NoneType` error when accessing `current.next.val`.
- Inside the loop, we compare the value of the current node with the value of the next node.
- If they are the same (`current.val == current.next.val`), we bypass the next node by setting `current.next` to `current.next.next`.
- If they are not the same, we move to the next node in the list by updating `current` to `current.next`.
- Finally, we return the `head` of the modified list.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's go through an example step by step:

- Given: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3
- Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3

Here's how the function operates:

1. Start at the first node (value 1).
2. Compare to the next node, which is also 1. Since they are the same, remove the duplicate.
3. Move to the next distinct value (now at node with value 2).
4. No duplicate for value 2, so move to the next node (first node with value 3).
5. Compare to the next node, also 3. Remove the duplicate.
6. We've reached the end of the list, so we're done.

### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We visit each node once, and the number of operations per node is constant, except for the potential deallocation of the bypassed nodes, which is also a constant-time operation.

The space complexity is O(1) as we're using a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

### Real-World Applications

This type of problem has practical applications in database querying where deduplication is a common task. It also serves as a fundamental operation in data processing pipelines where unique records need to be maintained.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Remember to check for the end of the list (`current.next` is not `None`) to avoid accessing attributes of `None`.
- Do not forget to handle edge cases where the list could be empty (i.e., the head is `None`).

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem illustrates the "two-pointer" technique, although in this specific case, we manage with a single moving pointer because the list is sorted. For other unsorted list variants, two pointers are commonly used.
