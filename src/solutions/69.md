LeetCode problem number 69 is "Sqrt(x)", which asks for the implementation of the `sqrt` function. The task is to compute and return the square root of a non-negative integer `x`. Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The challenge with this problem is to find the square root of an integer without using any built-in exponential functions or operators. This means that functions like `math.sqrt` or operations like `**0.5` are not allowed.

Here is a closer look at the problem details:
- The input is a non-negative integer `x`.
- The output should be the integer part of the square root of `x`. For example, `sqrt(8)` should return `2` and not `2.82842...` since `2` is the integer part of the result.
- If `x` is not a perfect square, the function should floor the square root value to get an integer result.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
There are a few different ways to approach this problem. Let's discuss some of them:

1. **Brute Force Method**: This would involve starting at 1 and squaring each number until the square is greater than `x`. The integer part of the square root would be the previous number. However, this approach is inefficient as it has a time complexity of O(sqrt(x)), which is too slow for large values of `x`.

2. **Binary Search Method**: Since the square root function is monotonically increasing, we can use binary search to find the square root. Start with a left bound of 0 and a right bound of `x`. Then iteratively narrow down the guess in the middle of this range.

3. **Newton's Method**: This is an iterative numerical method that can be used to approximate roots of functions. It can converge faster than binary search but requires a good initial guess and is slightly more complex to implement.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Let's implement the Binary Search method, which is the most common and efficient way to solve this problem.

```python
def mySqrt(x):
    if x < 2:
        return x
    
    left, right = 2, x // 2
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        num = mid * mid
        if num > x:
            right = mid - 1
        elif num < x:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            return mid
    
    return right
```

Breakdown of the code:
- `if x < 2: return x`: A quick check for the base cases 0 and 1. Both of these have square roots equal to themselves.
- `left, right = 2, x // 2`: We start our search between 2 and `x // 2`, as any square root of `x` larger than `x // 2` would square to more than `x`.
- `while left <= right`: This is our binary search loop. We continue searching as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
- `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`: We calculate the middle value. Using `left + (right - left) // 2` instead of `(left + right) // 2` avoids potential overflow.
- `num = mid * mid`: We square the middle value to compare it with `x`.
- `if num > x`: If `num` is greater than `x`, our `mid` is too high, so we adjust our right bound to `mid - 1`.
- `elif num < x`: If `num` is smaller than `x`, our `mid` is too low, so we adjust our left bound to `mid + 1`.
- `else: return mid`: If `num` is exactly `x`, we found an exact square root and return `mid`.
- `return right`: If we exit the while loop without finding an exact square root, `right` will be the floored integer square root of `x`.
