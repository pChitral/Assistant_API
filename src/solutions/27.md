LeetCode Problem 27 "Remove Element" is an exercise in array manipulation. Given an array `nums` and a value `val`, the problem asks you to remove all instances of `val` in `nums` in-place, such that each element that is not `val` appears before any instance of `val` in the array. The relative order of the elements may be changed. You need to return the new length of the array after the removal.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
The problem is straightforward but requires care to handle in-place array modification. Key considerations are:

1. You must modify the array in place, which means you cannot use extra space for another array.
2. The relative order of elements can change, which hints at the possibility of swapping elements.
3. You have to return the new length of the array, which is the number of elements that are not equal to `val`.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
The most efficient way to solve this problem is to use two pointers: one for traversing the array (`i`) and one for keeping track of the "new" array's last index (`newLength`).

1. Initialize `newLength` to be 0.
2. Loop over the array with `i`.
3. If `nums[i]` is not equal to `val`, copy `nums[i]` to `nums[newLength]`, and increment `newLength`.
4. If `nums[i]` is equal to `val`, do nothing and continue to the next iteration.
5. After the loop ends, the first `newLength` elements of `nums` are the elements excluding `val`, and `newLength` is the new length of the array without `val`.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
```python
def removeElement(nums, val):
    newLength = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != val:
            nums[newLength] = nums[i]
            newLength += 1
    return newLength
```

- `removeElement` is a function that takes a list `nums` and an integer `val` as arguments.
- `newLength` keeps track of the new length of the array and the index where the next non-`val` element should be placed.
- The `for` loop iterates through each element in the array.
- Inside the loop, there's a conditional to check if the current element is not equal to `val`. If it isn't, we assign that element to the `nums[newLength]` index and increment `newLength`.
- If the condition is not met (meaning the element is equal to `val`), the loop just continues to the next element.
- After going through all elements, `newLength`, which is the count of non-`val` elements, is returned as the new length of the array.

### Elaborate Examples
Let's take a few examples:

1. `nums = [3, 2, 2, 3]`, `val = 3`. The function should rearrange `nums` to `[2, 2, _, _]` and return `newLength = 2`.
2. `nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2]`, `val = 2`. The function should rearrange `nums` to `[0, 1, 3, 0, 4, _, _, _]` and return `newLength = 5`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we traverse the entire array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), we are not using any extra space that is dependent on the input size; we modify the array in-place.

### Real-World Applications
This problem emulates real-world scenarios where data filtering is necessary. For instance, if an array represents a list of sensor readings and a specific value indicates a faulty reading, we may want to remove those values before processing the data.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks
Some common pitfalls:
- Forgetting to increment `newLength` after a non-`val` element assignment.
- Using an extra array accidentally, which would not comply with the in-place requirement.

A useful trick:
- Since the problem allows modifying the order of elements, you can optimize by swapping in elements from the end of the array if you want to preserve some elements and still modify the array in place.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem follows the "two-pointers" pattern, which is often used when modifying an array in place is required. The key is to use one pointer as an iterator and the other to modify the array.
