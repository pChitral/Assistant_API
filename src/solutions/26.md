LeetCode Problem #26 is titled "Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array". The challenge is to remove duplicates from a sorted array in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length. You do not need to consider the elements beyond the new length.

Here's the problem statement for a detailed understanding:

Given a sorted array `nums`, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Clarification:
Confusion might occur because after function execution, it appears that the array still contains the duplicates (as you may print it or observe it in a debugger). However, the problem specifies that it's only the first part of the `nums` array that should contain the unique elements, up to the returned length.

### Example:
**Input:** nums = [1,1,2]
**Output:** 2, nums = [1,2,_]
The underscore indicates the irrelevant values which do not matter (they can be any value), since the question only cares about the elements before the new length (2 in this case).

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

The key to solving this problem is to use two pointers. Since the array is already sorted, duplicate elements are adjacent. We can have one pointer (`i`) for iterating over the array and another pointer (`j`) for keeping track of the position where the next unique element should be placed.

1. Initialize pointer `j` to `0`, which will be the index to insert the next unique element.
2. Iterate through the array with another pointer `i` starting from `1`.
3. Compare the current element `nums[i]` with the last unique element `nums[j]`.
4. If they are different, it means we found a new unique element; increment `j`, and then copy `nums[i]` to `nums[j]`.
5. If they are the same, skip `nums[i]` since it's a duplicate.
6. Continue this process until `i` has gone through the entire array.
7. The length of the array with unique elements will be `j + 1`.

### Python Code Explanation:

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    j = 0
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != nums[j]:
            j += 1
            nums[j] = nums[i]

    return j + 1
```

- We check if the array is empty first; if it is, we return 0 because there are no elements.
- We initialize the pointer `j` to 0 and point `i` to the second element in the array.
- In the for loop, we iterate from the second element to the end of the array.
- Inside the loop, we check if `nums[i]` is different from `nums[j]`. If it is, it means we found a unique element.
- We then increment `j` and update `nums[j]` with the value of `nums[i]` to store the unique element in place.
- After the loop finishes, `j + 1` is the new length of the array without duplicates.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because we pass through the array once with a single loop.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are only using existing space and not allocating any additional storage.

### Practical Applications:
Removing duplicates from a sorted list is a common task in many applications, such as:
- Database queries where you want to avoid duplicate records.
- Data pre-processing before applying machine learning algorithms.
- Managing sorted lists of user IDs, transaction IDs, etc., in back-end systems.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- Overlooking that the array is sorted, which is essential.
- Trying to create a new array or using extra space rather than modifying in-place.
- Forgetting to handle the edge case where the input array is empty.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem revolves around the "two-pointer" technique, often used in array manipulation, especially with sorted arrays. Recognizing such patterns helps to apply them to similar problems based on array transformation and in-place operations.

### Similar LeetCode Problems:
