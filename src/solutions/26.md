LeetCode Problem 26 is titled "Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array". Here, I'll provide an extensive breakdown of the problem, strategies for solving it, a detailed Python code explanation, elaborate examples, complexity analysis, real-world applications, common pitfalls and tricks, and connections to similar problems.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
The problem statement is as follows:

Given a sorted array `nums`, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length. You do not need to consider the elements beyond the new length.

More specifically:

- The input array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- It is necessary to modify the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
- The relative order of the elements should be maintained.
- It's not necessary to remove the extra space created by removed duplicates, just to ensure that the first part of the array contains no duplicates.
- The function should return the new length, which represents the number of unique elements.
- The elements beyond the new length can be left unchanged, as they won't be checked in the test cases.

#### Constraints and Nuances 

- The array can contain integers.
- The length of the array is at most 3 * 10^4.
- The values of integers are within the range [-100, 100].
- The array is guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The typical approach to solve this problem is to use two pointers:

1. **Initialization**: Start with two pointers, `i` and `j`, where `i` is slow-runner and `j` is a fast-runner. Initialize both to 1 (`i = j = 1`) since the first element is never a duplicate.

2. **Traversal**: As long as `j` is less than the length of the array, do the following:
   - If the current element at position `j` is different from the element at `j - 1`, copy the current element to position `i`, and then increment both pointers `i` and `j`.
   - If the current element at position `j` is the same as the element at `j - 1`, just increment `j` while `i` stays in its last position with a unique value.

3. **Return Value**: After the loop terminates, `i` will be at the position where the new length should end, thus return `i`.

This method leverages the fact that the array is sorted, so duplicates are always adjacent.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    i = 0
    for j in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[j] != nums[i]:
            i += 1
            nums[i] = nums[j]
    return i + 1
```

- `if not nums: return 0` checks for an empty array. If the array is empty, the function returns 0 immediately.
- `i = 0` initializes the slow-runner pointer.
- `for j in range(1, len(nums)):` starts the fast-runner at index 1 and iterates through the array.
- `if nums[j] != nums[i]:` checks if the current element is different from the last unique element that `i` points to.
- `i += 1` increments `i` to move to the next unique position.
- `nums[i] = nums[j]` copies the value from `j` to `i`, effectively overwriting duplicates with unique elements.
- `return i + 1` returns the count of unique elements since index `i` is zero-based.

### Elaborate Examples

For example: If the input array is `[1, 1, 2]`, the expected result is `2`, and the array should be modified to `[1, 2, _]`, the underscore `_` indicates we don't care what's beyond the second element. Here's how the algorithm would work:

- `i = 0`, `j = 1`. Since `nums[j] (1)` is equal to `nums[i] (1)`, just increment `j`. Now `i = 0`, `j = 2`.
- `i = 0`, `j = 2`. Since `nums[j] (2)` is not equal to `nums[i] (1)`, increment `i` and set `nums[i]` to `nums[j]`. Now `i = 1`, `nums = [1, 2, 2]`.
- Now that `j` has reached the end, we return `i + 1`, which is `2`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because each element is checked exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), only two variables `i` and `j` are used, and no additional space is required.

### Real-World Applications

An application for this algorithm could be data processing, where duplicate records need to be removed from a sorted list for data analysis or reporting purposes.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Forgetting to handle the empty array edge case separately can lead to index errors.
- Modifying the input array directly rather than returning a separate list is an important aspect. In an interview setting, clarifying in-place modification with the interviewer is crucial.
- Remembering not to use extra space for another array to hold unique values is essential to meet the space complexity requirement.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem is a classical example of the two-pointer technique, where pointers are used to traverse an array efficiently.
