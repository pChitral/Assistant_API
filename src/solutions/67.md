LeetCode Problem 67 is titled "Add Binary," which is a problem in the domain of string manipulation and binary arithmetic. Let's break down the problem statement and dive deep into how to solve it.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The "Add Binary" problem asks you to take two binary strings `a` and `b` as inputs and return their sum, also as a binary string. The binary strings are non-empty and contain only characters '1' or '0'.

Here are some important nuances to consider:
- The input strings are not guaranteed to be of the same length. This means we might need to handle the "carry" when the lengths of the strings differ.
- Since we're working with binary numbers, we need to remember that adding two '1's produces a '0' with a '1' carried over to the next significant bit.
- The problem should be solved without using built-in functions to convert binary strings to integers and vice versa.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
The solution strategy essentially follows the algorithm for adding two binary numbers, similar to how we do basic arithmetic addition.

Here is one way to approach it:
1. Start from the rightmost bits (least significant bits) of both strings.
2. Add the bits together one pair at a time, taking care to include any carry from the previous addition.
3. If one string is shorter, consider its missing bits as '0'.
4. Continue this process until all bits of both strings have been processed.
5. If there is a carry left after the last operation, add an additional bit with '1' to the result.

One method that can be helpful is to pad the shorter string with leading zeros to match the length of the longer string, simplifying the addition process as you can be assured both strings have equal lengths.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
We will iterate over the two strings from right to left, adding corresponding bits and tracking the carry. Here is how the code may look like:

```python
def addBinary(a, b):
    # Initialize result and carry
    result = []
    carry = 0
    
    # Pad the shorter string with zeros
    a, b = a.zfill(max(len(a), len(b))), b.zfill(max(len(a), len(b)))
    
    # Iterate over both strings from right to left
    for i in range(len(a) - 1, -1, -1):
        # Convert string bits to integers and add them, along with the carry
        total = carry + int(a[i]) + int(b[i])
        # The new bit is total modulo 2
        result.append(str(total % 2))
        # The new carry is total divided by 2
        carry = total // 2
    
    # If there's a carry left, add it to the result
    if carry != 0:
        result.append(str(carry))
    
    # The result should be reversed, as we started from the least significant digit
    return ''.join(reversed(result))
```

Let's go line by line:
- We initiate `result` as an empty list to store the resultant bits, and `carry` as 0.
- We use `.zfill()` method to pad the shorter string with leading zeros to match the lengths; this ensures that we can simply iterate over the bits without checking string lengths at each step.
- We iterate backward over the strings' lengths using a `for` loop and `range`.
- For each bit position, we add the corresponding bits and the carry, converting them from strings to integers.
- We compute the new bit by taking `total % 2` and append it to the result.
- We update the carry by integer-dividing the total by 2, `total // 2`.
- After the loop, we add a remaining carry if it exists.
- We join the reversed result list into a string and return it.

### Elaborate Examples:
Let's walk through an example where `a = "1010"` and `b = "1011"`:
```
           1  (carry)
    1010  (a)
+   1011  (b)
---------
   10101  (result)
```
So the function should return "10101".

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(n), because we iterate through the strings once, where n is the maximum length of the two strings.
- Space Complexity: O(n), the space needed for the resulting binary string, which in the worst case is one bit longer than the input strings.

### Real-World Applications:
The binary addition algorithm has numerous real-world applications, such as in digital circuit design, computer arithmetic, and various algorithms that involve binary operations.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- Not handling the different lengths of input strings can easily lead to errors. Padding with zeros simplifies this.
- Forgetting to add the last carry can also lead to incorrect results.
- Reverse the result at the end, as we build the result string from the least significant bit to the most.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
The pattern here is "two-pointer" or "simultaneous iteration", often used when you need to work with two sequences at the same time.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:
Similar problems usually involve manipulating bit strings or arithmetic operations on non-decimal representations:
- LeetCode 2: Add Two Numbers (addition with linked lists)
- LeetCode 415: Add Strings (addition with decimal strings)
- LeetCode 989: Add to Array-Form of Integer (addition with decimal digit arrays)

Each of these requires a similar handling of carries during the addition process, and understanding how to solve "Add Binary" can directly translate to solving these problems.
