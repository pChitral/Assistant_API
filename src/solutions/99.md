LeetCode Problem #99 is titled "Recover Binary Search Tree." In this problem, you are given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST) where exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. The challenge is to recover the tree without changing its structure.

### Problem Statement Overview:

Let's define what a Binary Search Tree (BST) is: it is a tree where for each node, all nodes to its left have smaller values, and all nodes to its right have larger values. The problem implies that two nodes in this tree have been swapped, which causes the property of the BST to be violated.

Your goal is to find these two nodes and swap them back to correct the BST. The condition is that you must do this with the original tree structure intact, meaning that you cannot construct a new tree but rather must change the values in the existing nodes.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

The most straightforward method to identify the swapped nodes would be to do an in-order traversal of the BST. An in-order traversal of a correctly structured BST will yield the elements in sorted (ascending) order. If two nodes have been swapped, their values will be out of order in this traversal.

During the in-order traversal, we should find two pairs of consecutive nodes where the first node is larger than the second. In case these nodes are adjacent in the traversal, there will only be one such pair; otherwise, there will be two such pairs.

Once we identify the nodes that are out of order, we need to swap their values. Here's the high-level approach for the algorithm:

1. Perform an in-order traversal and keep track of the elements as you visit them.
2. Identify the nodes that are out of their proper order.
3. Swap the values of the identified nodes.

This problem can be solved using either iterative or recursive in-order traversal. We will discuss the recursive approach, which is often more straightforward to understand.

### Python Code Explanation:

Below is a Python function that can solve this problem using recursion:

```python
def recoverTree(root):
    # These pointers will be used to keep track of the swapped nodes
    first = second = None
    prev = TreeNode(float('-inf'))
    
    # Helper function to perform in-order traversal
    def inorder(node):
        nonlocal first, second, prev
        if not node:
            return
        
        # Visit left subtree
        inorder(node.left)
        
        # Find the first and second nodes that are out of order
        if prev.val > node.val:
            if not first:
                first = prev
            second = node
        
        # Update the previous node visited
        prev = node
        
        # Visit right subtree
        inorder(node.right)
        
    inorder(root)
    
    # Swap the values of the first and second node
    first.val, second.val = second.val, first.val
```

Let's break down the code:

1. We declare two pointers `first` and `second` to track the nodes that need to be swapped. `prev` points to the last node visited in the in-order traversal.
2. The helper function `inorder` performs an in-order traversal of the tree.
3. In the traversal, we compare the value of the current node with the `prev` node. If `prev.val > node.val`, it means the order is incorrect.
4. If 'first' is not already set, we set it to the previous ('prev') node, because this is the first time we've encountered a decrease in the value as we traverse. The current node is a candidate for the 'second' node, which might be the one swapped with 'first'.
5. We then set the `prev` to the current node each time, ensuring we're always comparing a node with its immediate predecessor in the in-order sequence.
6. After traversal, we swap the values of `first` and `second`, effectively recovering the tree.

### Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once during the in-order traversal.

The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree. In the worst case, the height of the tree is N (the tree is a linked list), and in the best case, it is log(N) (the tree is balanced). This space is used by the call stack due to recursion. For a balanced tree, this space complexity can be considered O(logN).

### Real-World Applications:

This problem mimics real-world scenarios where a data structure is compromised due to a couple of erroneous elements, and the goal is to identify and fix it without a complete rebuild â€” similar to correcting a database or file system corruption involving specific records or entries.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Forgetting to update the `prev` node during traversal can lead to incorrect identification of swapped nodes.
- It's essential to handle the edge case where the swapped nodes are adjacent in the in-order traversal.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

The solution to this problem primarily involves an in-order traversal of a binary tree. This pattern is common in tree manipulation and searching problems, as it provides a way to process nodes in a sorted order based on their values.
