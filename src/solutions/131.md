LeetCode Problem 131 is "Palindrome Partitioning". This problem is about backtracking and recursion. Let's break down the problem in detail:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The problem reads as follows:
Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of `s`.

A palindrome is a word or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. The problem asks us to return all different ways we can split the given string into substrings that are individual palindromes.

For instance, if the input string is "aab", then the output should be `[["aa","b"], ["a","a","b"]]`. This is because there are two ways to split the string where every substring is a palindrome. The substrings "aa" and "b" are both palindromes in the first case, and each character "a", "a", and "b" is a separate palindrome in the second case.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, we will approach it using backtracking. Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving recursive problems by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, and removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.

Here are the steps we would generally follow for this approach:

1. Start with an empty list of partitions and a starting index of 0.
2. Iterate over the string from the starting index to the end of the string.
3. For each index, check if the substring from the start index to the current index is a palindrome.
4. If it is a palindrome, add this substring to the current partition list and recursively call the function with the current list of partitions and the next index as the starting point.
5. If it is not a palindrome, continue to the next index.
6. When the starting index reaches the end of the string, add the current list of partitions to the result list as one of the possible partitionings.
7. Backtrack after each recursive call to remove the last added partition and try other possibilities.

For checking if a substring is a palindrome, we can write a helper function that takes the string and two indices (start and end) and checks if the substring is a palindrome by comparing characters from the outermost pair inward.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

In the next section, I will provide the Python code for this solution and explain each part of it.

### Elaborate Examples

After providing the code, we will also walk through a detailed example to see how the backtracking works step by step.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

We will analyze the time and space complexity based on the recursive calls and the number of potential partitions.

### Real-World Applications

Finding all partitions of a string that are palindromes is not just a theoretical problem but can be applied in areas such as natural language processing, data segmentation, and cryptography.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

We'll look into common mistakes, such as failing to properly backtrack, not correctly checking for palindromes, or having inefficiencies in the recursion.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The problem follows the backtracking pattern, which can also be identified in other similar problems like "Combinations" or "Permutations".
