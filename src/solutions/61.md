LeetCode Problem 61 is titled "Rotate List." First, let's break down the problem statement and understand its requirements.

### Problem Statement:
Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by `k` places.

### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Input:**
  - `head`: The first node of a singly linked list.
  - `k`: An integer representing the number of rotations to the right.

- **Output:**
  - Return the head of the rotated linked list.

### Nuances and Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 500]`.
- The values of the nodes in the list are within the range `[-100, 100]`.
- `k` can be any non-negative integer, including 0, and might be larger than the number of nodes in the list.

### Understanding the Problem:
Rotating a linked list by `k` places to the right means that the last `k % n` nodes (where `n` is the length of the linked list) will be moved to the front of the list. If `k` is larger than `n`, the list will effectively be rotated `k % n` times because rotating the list `n` times returns the list to its original position.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
To solve this problem, we would typically follow these steps:

1. First, if the list is empty (head is `None`), we can immediately return `None`.
2. Find the length of the linked list by iterating through it. This is necessary to determine the effective number of rotations needed (`k % n`).
3. If `k` is a multiple of the length of the list (`k % n == 0`), the list remains unchanged after rotation, and we can return the head as is.
4. Otherwise, we connect the tail of the list with the head, making it a circular list.
5. Determine the new tail of the list, which will be at the node `(n - k % n - 1)` from the start, and the new head will be the next node.
6. The next step after finding the new tail is to disconnect the circular list by setting the `next` pointer of the new tail to `None`.

### Python Code Explanation:
The Python code will implement these steps in functions to manipulate the linked list structure. The linked list node class (`ListNode`) would be provided in the problem's description.

### Time and Space Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of the solution will be `O(n)` because we have to traverse the entire list to find its length and then perform another traversal to find the new tail.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity of the solution is `O(1)` as we are not using any additional data structures that grow with the input size.

### Edge Case Examples:
- A list of length 0 (should return `None`).
- A list with `k` equal to the length of the list (should return the original list).
- A list with `k` greater than the length of the list (should rotate the list effectively `k % n` times).

Now, let's proceed with the detailed Python code to solve this problem.
