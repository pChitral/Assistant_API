LeetCode Problem 61 is titled "Rotate List." The challenge is to rotate a singly linked list to the right by k places, where k is a non-negative integer. Let's break down the problem into detailed steps and discuss the nuances that could affect the implementation. Afterward, I'll provide an in-depth solution rationale, a detailed Python code explanation, and various examples to demonstrate the solution.

### Problem Breakdown:
Given a singly-linked list and a non-negative integer k, the task is to rotate the list to the right by k places. If k is greater or equal to the length of the list, the rotation should wrap around.

Some things to keep in mind:
- A singly-linked list means each node only has a reference to the next node. There is no reference to the previous node.
- Rotating the list to the right by one place means that the last element becomes the first element.
- Rotating by an amount that is a multiple of the list's length should return the list in its original state, as each full rotation doesn't change the list.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer technique along with a few steps to efficiently rotate the list.

1. **Compute the length of the list.** This will help us normalize the value of k in case it is larger than the length of the list.
2. **Normalize k.** Since rotating a list with length `L` by `L` or any multiple of `L` results in the same list, we can use `k = k % L` to find the effective number of rotations needed.
3. **Find the new tail.** We need to find the new tail of the list, which will be the `(L - k - 1)`th node after normalization. This new tail's next node will be the new head after rotation.
4. **Rotate the list.** Set the current tail's `next` pointer to `None` and set the `next` pointer of the previous tail (before rotation) to what used to be the head of the list.

Strategic decisions include handling edge cases such as when the list is empty or when `k` is 0, as no rotation is necessary.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Here's what each part of the implementation does:

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head or not head.next or k == 0:
            return head  # No rotation needed
        
        # Compute the length of the list and the last node
        length = 1
        last_node = head
        while last_node.next:
            last_node = last_node.next
            length += 1
            
        # Normalize k
        k %= length
        
        if k == 0:
            return head  # The list remains the same after rotation
        
        # Find the new tail after rotation
        new_tail = head
        for _ in range(length - k - 1):
            new_tail = new_tail.next
        
        # Perform the rotation
        new_head = new_tail.next
        new_tail.next = None
        last_node.next = head
        
        return new_head
```

### Elaborate Examples:
- **Example 1:** List = `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`, k = 2. The rotated list should be `4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3`.
- **Example 2:** List = `0 -> 1 -> 2`, k = 4. Since k > length of list, k %= length = 1. The rotated list should be `2 -> 0 -> 1`.
- **Example 3:** List = `1`, k = 99. Since the list has only one element, any rotation will result in the same list.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the list. We go through the list to find its length, then we possibly iterate again to the rotation point.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as the rotation is done in-place and no additional data structure is used.

### Real-World Applications:
Rotating lists can be likened to scheduling tasks, where cycles are common and elements need to be moved around for prioritization or resource allocation. It is also a good representation of any system that requires circular handling, such as a round-robin tournament schedule.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- Forgetting to handle edge cases like an empty list, a list with only one element, or k being zero.
- Not normalizing k, leading to unnecessary iterations and potentially incorrect rotations.
- Missing the connection between the old tail and new head, resulting in lost nodes and an incomplete list.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem is an example of a linked list manipulation, specifically involving pointers and node reassignment. Recognizing this pattern aids in solving similar problems like reversing a linked list, merging two sorted linked lists, and dealing with cycles in linked lists.
