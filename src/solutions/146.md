LeetCode problem number 146 refers to the "LRU Cache" problem. Let's break down this problem in detail:

## Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache is a data structure that provides fast access to its entries and maintains the order of usage to quickly identify and remove the least recently used items when the capacity is exceeded. The LRU Cache problem has the following characteristics:

- The cache should support the `get` and `put` operations.
- `get(key)` should return the value of the key if the key exists in the cache, else return -1.
- `put(key, value)` should update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, it should add the key-value pair to the cache. If the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before adding the new item.
- The LRU Cache has a fixed size, and when inserting an element that would exceed this size, the least recently used element is evicted from the cache.
- All operations must be performed in O(1) time complexity.

The nuances of this problem involve ensuring that the `get` and `put` operations are both time-efficient and that the LRU eviction happens correctly.

## In-Depth Solution Rationale:
To achieve the O(1) time complexity for both get and put operations, we need to use a data structure that supports fast access, insertion, and deletion. The ideal candidate is a combination of a hash table and a doubly linked list.

- **Hash Table**: Allows us to quickly look up the existence of an item, and get/set a value by key in O(1) time.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Allows us to quickly add/remove items from the ends of the list (necessary to maintain LRU order) in O(1) time.

Here's the strategy for using these structures:

1. Store each key paired with a reference to its corresponding node in the list (which contains the value) in a hash table.
2. Maintain a doubly linked list of nodes, where each node contains a key-value pair. The front of the list represents the most recently used items, and the back represents the least recently used items.
3. Whenever `get` is called, move the accessed item to the front of the list to mark it as most recently used.
4. Whenever `put` is called, insert the new item at the front of the list. If the key already exists, update the value and move the item to the front. If the capacity is exceeded, remove the item at the back of the list, and also remove its key from the hash table.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, key=None, value=None):
        self.key = key
        self.value = value
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None

class LRUCache:

    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.cache = {}  # Maps key to node
        self.head = ListNode()  # Dummy head
        self.tail = ListNode()  # Dummy tail
        self.head.next = self.tail  # Initialize the linked list
        self.tail.prev = self.head

    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        if key in self.cache:
            node = self.cache[key]
            self._remove(node)
            self._add(node)
            return node.value
        return -1

    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
        if key in self.cache:
            self._remove(self.cache[key])
        node = ListNode(key, value)
        self.cache[key] = node
        self._add(node)
        if len(self.cache) > self.capacity:
            lru_node = self.tail.prev
            self._remove(lru_node)
            del self.cache[lru_node.key]

    def _add(self, node):
        head_next = self.head.next
        self.head.next = node
        node.prev = self.head
        node.next = head_next
        head_next.prev = node

    def _remove(self, node):
        node.prev.next = node.next
        node.next.prev = node.prev

# Usage:
# cache = LRUCache(2)
# cache.put(1, 1)
# cache.put(2, 2)
# print(cache.get(1))       # returns 1
# cache.put(3, 3)           # evicts key 2
# print(cache.get(2))       # returns -1 (not found)
# cache.put(4, 4)           # evicts key 1
# print(cache.get(1))       # returns -1 (not found)
# print(cache.get(3))       # returns 3
# print(cache.get(4))       # returns 4
```

The code snippet above defines a class `ListNode` to represent a node in the doubly linked list, and a class `LRUCache` that implements the LRU Cache as described.

- The `_add` private method adds a node to the front of the doubly linked list.
- The `_remove` private method removes a node from its current position in the doubly linked list.
- The `get` method will check if the key is in the cache, and if it is, it moves the node to the front to mark it as recently used before returning the value.
- The `put` method adds a new node to the front of the list or updates the value of an existing node and also ensures the capacity is not exceeded by removing the LRU item.

## Elaborate Examples:
Assuming our LRUCache is instantiated with a capacity of 2:

1. `cache.put(1, 1)` – Adds key 1 with value 1. List is now [1].
2. `cache.put(2, 2)` – Adds key 2 with value 2. List is now [2, 1].
3. `cache.get(1)` – Returns 1 and moves key 1 to the front. List is now [1, 2].
4. `cache.put(3, 3)` – Adds key 3 with value 3 and removes key 2 (LRU). List is now [3, 1].
5. `cache.get(2)` – Returns -1 because key 2 has been evicted.
6. `cache.put(4, 4)` – Adds key 4 with value 4 and removes key 1 (LRU). List is now [4, 3].
7. `cache.get(1)` – Returns -1 because key 1 has been evicted.
8. `cache.get(3)` – Returns 3.
9. `cache.get(4)` – Returns 4.

## Thorough Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity of both `get` and `put` operations is O(1). This is because accessing the hash table, adding an item to the front of the list, and removing an item from the list (either designated by the hash table or the last one) are all constant-time operations.

The space complexity is O(capacity), as it stores up to capacity key-value pairs in both the hash table and the doubly linked list.

## Real-World Applications:
A real-world application of an LRU cache could be seen in a web browser caching web pages. The browser would cache a fixed number of pages, and when this number is exceeded, the least recently viewed page would be removed from the cache to make room for a new one. Other applications include caching in operating systems, databases, and web servers.

## Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- One of the common pitfalls is not properly updating the doubly linked list when getting/putting keys, which might lead to incorrect LRU order or lost references.
- A tip is to use dummy head and tail nodes, as they simplify the edge case handling when adding or removing nodes from the list.

## Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem is a classic example of the "Design" type, where one needs to design a data structure that satisfies specific constraints. It also involves linked lists manipulation and hash table usage, patterns that appear in numerous other data structure problems.
