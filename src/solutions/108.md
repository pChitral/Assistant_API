Problem number 108 on LeetCode is titled "Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree". The problem statement is as follows:

Given an integer array `nums` where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree (BST).

A height-balanced binary tree is a tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

#### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem requires you to take a sorted array and construct a BST from it, such that the resulting BST is height-balanced. The key aspects of this problem that we need to understand are:

1. **Binary Search Tree**: A BST is a binary tree where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child, and satisfies the BST property: for any node `N`, all nodes in the left subtree of `N` have values less than `N`'s value, and all nodes in the right subtree have values greater than `N`'s value.

2. **Height-Balanced**: A binary tree is said to be height-balanced if for any node in the tree, the height of the left and right subtrees differs by at most one. The height of a subtree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

3. **Sorted Array**: The input is a sorted array, which simplifies the process of constructing the BST because you don't have to search for the correct position for each elementâ€”it's already given by the order in the array.

4. **Construction**: You must build the BST from the bottom up, ensuring that it is height-balanced. This involves finding the middle of the array (which will be the root of the BST or a subtree), and recursively applying this strategy to the left and right halves of the array to form the left and right subtrees, respectively.

#### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, we need to utilize a recursive approach. Here are the steps:

1. Identify the base case, which is when the current part of the array has no elements left.
2. Find the middle of the current part of the array to ensure the left and right subtrees have an equal (or as close to equal as possible) number of nodes.
3. Create a tree node with the value of the middle element.
4. Recursively perform the same operation on the left half of the array to create the left subtree.
5. Recursively perform the same operation on the right half of the array to create the right subtree.
6. Set the left and right children of the current node to the roots of the left and right subtree, respectively.

The reason we choose the middle element as the root (or the root of any subtree) is to keep the tree height-balanced. A recursive approach naturally lends itself to this problem because it mimics the way we would construct a BST manually: Start with the root, then create the left and right subtrees, and so on.

#### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Here's how the recursive function might look in Python:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def sortedArrayToBST(nums):
    if not nums:
        return None

    mid = len(nums) // 2
    root = TreeNode(nums[mid])
    root.left = sortedArrayToBST(nums[:mid])
    root.right = sortedArrayToBST(nums[mid + 1:])

    return root
```

Let's break down the code:

- We define a `TreeNode` class that represents a node in a BST, having a `val`, `left`, and `right`.
- In the `sortedArrayToBST` function, we first handle the base case: if `nums` is empty, we return `None`, which represents an empty tree.
- We find the middle index of the array using `len(nums) // 2`. Using integer division ensures that we get a whole number, even if the length of `nums` is even. In the case of an even length, the "middle" element will be the one on the right of the middle point.
- We create a `TreeNode` with the value of the middle element.
- We recursively call `sortedArrayToBST` for the left half (`nums[:mid]`) and right half (`nums[mid + 1:]`) of the array. These calls will return the root nodes of the left and right subtrees, respectively.
- We assign these to `root.left` and `root.right`, and finally, we return the `root` node.

#### Elaborate Examples:

Let's go through an example:

Given `nums = [-10, -3, 0, 5, 9]`, our function would proceed as follows:

1. The middle of the array is `0`, which becomes the root of the BST.
2. The left subtree is built from `[-10, -3]`: The middle is `-3`, which becomes the left child of the root.
3. The left subtree of `-3` is built from `[-10]`: Since there is only one element, it becomes the left child of `-3`.
4. There is no right subtree for `-3` because there are no elements left on the right side of `-10`.
5. The right subtree is built from `[5, 9]`: The middle is `9`, which becomes the right child of the root.
6. The left subtree of `9` is built from `[5]`: Since there is only one element, it becomes the left child of `9`.
7. There is no right subtree for `9` as there are no elements left.

Thus, the final BST structure would be:

```
        0
       / \
     -3   9
     /   /
  -10   5
```

#### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

Time complexity:
- The function visits each element once when creating nodes, which gives us O(N) time complexity, where N is the number of elements in the input array.
- It's important to note that slicing the array as done in `nums[:mid]` and `nums[mid + 1:]` can add additional time complexity since slicing is O(k) where k is the length of the slice. However, in some Python implementations, this can be considered O(1) due to the way memory is handled.

Space complexity:
- O(N) for storing the created BST.
- O(log N) for the recursive call stack, since the tree is height balanced.

#### Real-World Applications:

Understanding how to construct a balanced BST from a sorted array is not only a common interview question but also has practical uses in the real world. For instance, a BST can be used for efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions of data. Having a balanced BST ensures that these operations can be done in O(log N) time, which significantly improves performance for large datasets.

#### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

Some common pitfalls and tips to watch out for in this problem:

1. Remember the base case for the recursion to avoid infinite recursion.
2. When selecting the middle element, make sure you're moving to a different part of the array in each recursive call to prevent overlapping ranges.
3. Be mindful of slicing costs, you could pass array bounds instead to avoid extra costs and modify the function signature accordingly.

#### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem falls within the pattern of "divide and conquer". Recognizing that a large problem (like converting an entire array into a BST) can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem (forming left and right subtrees) is key to solving it efficiently.
