LeetCode problem number 50 is titled "Pow(x, n)", which asks you to implement the function `pow(x, n)`, which calculates `x` raised to the power of `n` (`x^n`).

Here's a detailed breakdown of the problem:

### Problem Statement

We need to implement the power function which receives two inputs: a floating-point number `x` and an integer `n`. The function should return the result of raising `x` to the power `n`, which is mathematically represented as `x^n`.

### Constraints

- `-100.0 < x < 100.0`: The base `x` is a floating point number within the range of -100 to 100.
- `-2^31 <= n <= 2^31-1`: The exponent `n` is an integer within the range of the 32-bit signed integer.
- The solution must handle all edge cases such as `n` being negative or zero.

### Solution Rationale

There are several ways to approach this problem, but two methods are commonly used due to their efficiency: the iterative and recursive approaches using the concept of "Exponentiation by Squaring".

1. **Exponential by Squaring (Recursive Approach)**: This approach leverages the fact that `x^n` can be split into `(x^(n/2)) * (x^(n/2))` if `n` is even, or `x * (x^((n-1)/2)) * (x^((n-1)/2))` if `n` is odd. The recursive calls continue to split the problem in half at each step until the base case is reached.

2. **Exponential by Squaring (Iterative Approach)**: This follows the same logic as the recursive approach but avoids the overhead of recursive calls by using a loop. This can be faster due to better utilization of memory and fewer function calls.

3. **Brute force** approach is to multiply `x` with itself `n` times, but it will be highly inefficient for large values of `n` and hence is not practical for this problem due to time complexity constraints.

The exponential by squaring method is preferred over brute force for its efficiency in time complexity. It reduces the complexity from O(n) to O(log n) where n is the exponent.

### Edge Cases

The implementation must handle cases where:
- `n` is negative: Calculate the power for positive `n` and take the reciprocal.
- `n` is zero: The result is always `1` regardless of `x`.
- `x` is zero or one: Return `x` since any number to zero power is `1` and one raised to any power remains `1`. 

### Python Code Explanation

Here's an example Python implementation using the recursive approach:

```python
# Recursive implementation of power function using exponentiation by squaring
def myPow(x: float, n: int) -> float:
    if n < 0:
        # Handle the case where n is negative
        x = 1 / x
        n = -n
    return fastPow(x, n)

def fastPow(x: float, n: int) -> float:
    if n == 0:
        # Base case: any number raised to the power of 0 is 1
        return 1.0
    half = fastPow(x, n // 2)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        # If n is even, multiply the results of half*half
        return half * half
    else:
        # If n is odd, multiply x with the results of half*half
        return x * half * half
```

In the above code:
- The `myPow` function takes care of negative exponents by taking the reciprocal of `x` and converting `n` into a positive exponent.
- The `fastPow` function is the recursive function that performs the actual computation.
- This function uses integer division (`//`) to halve `n` and the modulo operator (`%`) to check if `n` is even or odd.
- The base case of the recursion is when `n` is `0`, and by definition `x^0 = 1`.

### Examples

Let's run through a couple of examples to demonstrate the solution:

1. `myPow(2.00000, 10)` should return `1024.00000` because `2^10 = 1024`.
2. `myPow(2.10000, 3)` should return `9.26100` because `2.1^3 â‰ˆ 9.261`.
3. `myPow(2.00000, -2)` should return `0.25000` because `2^-2 = 1/2^2 = 0.25`.

### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the recursive solution is O(log n) because with each recursive call, we halve the exponent until it reaches zero.

The space complexity is also O(log n) due to the recursive call stack. Even though the iterative approach eliminates the recursive call stack, the time complexity would still remain O(log n).

### Real-World Applications

The power function is widely used in numerous real-world applications such as scientific computing, financial modeling (compound interest calculations), computer graphics (scaling), and any other domain where exponentiation is needed.
