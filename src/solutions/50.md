LeetCode Problem 50 is "Pow(x, n)", which asks you to implement `pow(x, n)`, which calculates `x` raised to the power `n` (i.e. \(x^n\)). Here is the full problem statement:

Implement `pow(x, n)`, which calculates `x` raised to the power `n` (\(x^n\)).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
Output: 1024.00000
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3
Output: 9.26100
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2^-2 = 1/2^2 = 1/4 = 0.25
```

**Constraints:**

- `-100.0 < x < 100.0`
- `-2^31 <= n <= 2^31-1`
- `-10^4 <= x^n <= 10^4`

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

This problem is essentially to calculate the power function without using the in-built power function in Python or any other language, for that matter. Here are the main components of the problem:

1. The base `x` is a floating-point number, and `n` is an integer.
2. The value of `n` can be negative, which implies that the result should be 1 divided by the power of `x` when `n` is positive.
3. The problem explicitly mentions not to use library functions like `pow()` or `**`, so the solution must be designed using other means.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, we need to consider efficiency because the naïve approach of simply multiplying `x` by itself `n` times would not be acceptable for large values of `n`.

A popular and efficient method to tackle this problem is to use 'Exponentiation by squaring,' which is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. This technique reduces the number of multiplications needed to calculate power, as follows:

- If `n` is even, you can calculate \(x^{n/2}\) and then square the result.
- If `n` is odd, you can calculate \(x^{(n-1)/2}\) and then square the result and multiply by `x`.

It's important to also handle the case when `n` is negative. If `n` is negative, you can apply the same logic as above, but at the end, you take the reciprocal of the result (since \(x^{-n} = 1/x^n\)).

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's write the Python code that implements the described approach.

```python
def myPow(x, n):
    if n < 0:
        x = 1 / x
        n = -n
        
    def power(x, n):
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        half = power(x, n // 2)
        if n % 2 == 0:
            return half * half
        else:
            return half * half * x

    return power(x, n)
```

Explanations of the code are as follows:

- In the `myPow` function, we first check if `n` is negative. If it is, we invert `x` by taking `1/x` and negate `n` to work with positive exponent only.
- We define a helper function `power(x, n)` that implements the logic for positive `n`.
  - If `n` is zero, we return 1 because any number to the power of 0 is 1.
  - We calculate the power for `n // 2` (integer division by 2) recursively. This halves the exponent in each recursive call and squares the result, utilizing the divide-and-conquer approach.
  - If `n` is even, we simply return `half * half`.
  - If `n` is odd, we have to multiply an additional `x` because we took out one `x` when we reduced the problem size (n was reduced by 1 before halving).
  
- Finally, the `myPow` function returns the result of the `power(x, n)` call.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is \(O(\log n)\) due to the divide and conquer algorithm. Each time we halve the exponent, reducing the number of multiplications needed.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(\log n)\) as well, which is due to the recursion stack. Each recursive call adds a level to the stack.

### Real-World Applications:

This type of problem solving is particularly useful in cryptography, where exponentiation with large numbers is a core operation, as well as in various scientific computing problems that require efficient and accurate computations involving powers.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Handling the case where `n` is negative is crucial, as forgetting it can lead to incorrect results.
- A direct iterative approach might seem simpler but is less efficient—abandoning it for a more complex but significantly more efficient approach is often necessary.
- In the real world, dealing with floating-point numbers would require careful considerations regarding precision and rounding errors, which are beyond this problem's scope.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem is a typical example of the divide-and-conquer strategy, where a large problem is broken down into smaller subproblems, which are solved individually, with their solutions then being combined to solve the larger original problem.
