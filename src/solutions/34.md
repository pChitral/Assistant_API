LeetCode problem number 34 refers to "Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array", which is a classic binary search problem. Here is a detailed breakdown of the problem and a comprehensive analysis of its solution.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The problem statement is as follows:

Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given `target` value. If the target is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

Since the array is sorted and the requirement is for an `O(log n)` runtime complexity, this implies that we should be using a binary search algorithm. However, a typical binary search algorithm only finds one occurrence of the target value. We need to modify it to find the first and last positions of the target value.

**Solution Strategy:**

1. Perform a binary search to find any index of the target value (`mid`).
2. Once we find a `mid` index where `nums[mid] == target`, we need to find the leftmost and rightmost indices of the target value.
3. To find the leftmost index, we can apply binary search on the sub-array to the left of `mid` (i.e., from start to `mid - 1`) and keep updating our left boundary whenever we find the target.
4. To find the rightmost index, apply binary search on the sub-array to the right of `mid` (i.e., from `mid + 1` to end) and keep updating our right boundary whenever we find the target.
5. Return the leftmost and rightmost indices as the answer.

The reason for applying binary search separately for finding the leftmost and rightmost indices is to ensure that we are not simply stopping at the first instance of the target value we find. Instead, we explore the sorted array to find the boundaries of all occurrences of the target.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

```python
def searchRange(nums, target):
    def findLeft(nums, target):
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return left

    def findRight(nums, target):
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if nums[mid] <= target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return right
    
    left, right = findLeft(nums, target), findRight(nums, target)
    
    # Check if the target is not found
    if left > right:
        return [-1, -1]
    
    return [left, right]
```

**Code Breakdown:**

- `findLeft()` and `findRight()` are helper functions that implement binary search to find the leftmost and the rightmost index of the target, respectively.
- `findLeft()` searches for the first occurrence where the number is no smaller than the target, capturing the left boundary of the target numbers.
- Similarly, `findRight()` searches for the last occurrence where the number is the target or less, capturing the right boundary.
- Notice that `findLeft()` and `findRight()` differ in their comparison: 
  - `findLeft()` uses `nums[mid] < target` to adjust the `left` and `right`.
  - `findRight()` uses `nums[mid] <= target` so that it keeps moving to the right even when it finds the target value.
- We check if `left` is greater than `right` to determine if the target was not found in the array.
- If the target is found, `left` and `right` will represent the first and last positions of the target value, which we return as a list.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's go through a few examples to illustrate how the solution works:

Example 1:
```
nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10]
target = 8
The expected answer is: [3, 4]
```
The flow is:
- Start with `findLeft()` to locate the first 8, in this case, index 3.
- Then, apply `findRight()` to find the last occurrence, which is index 4.
- The result is `[3, 4]`.

Example 2:
```
nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10]
target = 6
The expected answer is: [-1, -1]
```
The flow is:
- `findLeft()` would finish with `left` as index 2.
- `findRight()` would finish with `right` as index 1.
- Since `left > right`, the method returns `[-1, -1]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: The algorithm runs in `O(log n)` time because binary search is applied twice, each time halving the search space, therefore, keeping the logarithmic time complexity.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is `O(1)` because we only use a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

### Real-World Applications

This problem can be applied to any situation requiring a search for a range or an interval within a sorted dataset. Examples include finding time intervals in logs, price ranges in stock data, or even a range of pages where a term appears in a sorted index.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- It's easy to mistakenly return after finding a single instance of the target value instead of searching for the range.
- Incorrect handling of the boundaries may result in off-by-one errors; careful attention must be paid to the conditions within the while loops and the final return statements.
- Ensuring that binary search conditions appropriately deal with duplicates is a subtle detail that can cause bugs if overlooked.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem is a variant of binary search, a common pattern where the problem space is halved iteratively. Recognizing this pattern helps solve similar problems that require searching through a sorted dataset.
