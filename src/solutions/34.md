The LeetCode problem number 34 is titled "Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array". This is categorized under the 'Array' and 'Binary Search' topics. Let's delve into an exhaustive analysis of the problem, solution strategies, and explore the intricacies of the task at hand.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The problem statement can be summarized as follows:

- You are given an array of integers `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, and an integer `target`.
- Your task is to find the starting and ending position of a given `target` value in the array.
- If the target is not found in the array, you should return `[-1, -1]`.
- You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

Some nuances of the problem that must be considered:

1. Since the array is sorted, binary search is a natural choice to achieve the required `O(log n)` runtime complexity.
2. You need to identify not just one instance of the target, but the range of indices where the target appears.
3. Handling cases where the target value occurs at the edges of the array or multiple times within it.
4. The need to differentiate between finding no occurrence of the target and finding it at either the first, last, or somewhere in the middle of the array.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The intuition behind the solution is to perform binary search twice, with slight modifications each time. The first binary search identifies the first index where the target occurs, while the second search identifies the last index. Here's a more detailed strategy:

1. **First Occurrence**: To find the left boundary (first occurrence), we modify the binary search such that when we discover an instance of the target value, we continue searching to the left half to ensure there is no other instance of the target before the one found.

2. **Last Occurrence**: Similarly, to find the right boundary (last occurrence), we conduct a binary search where if the target is found, we search the right half of the array to confirm there is no other instance of the target after the one found.

We take advantage of the sorted property for these searches, ensuring that all occurrences of the target are contiguous.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Here, I'll propose a Python function that implements the strategy described above:

```python
def searchRange(nums, target):
    def findLeft(nums, target):
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            elif nums[mid] > target:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                if mid == 0 or nums[mid - 1] != target:
                    return mid
                right = mid - 1
        return -1

    def findRight(nums, target):
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            elif nums[mid] > target:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                if mid == len(nums) - 1 or nums[mid + 1] != target:
                    return mid
                left = mid + 1
        return -1

    return [findLeft(nums, target), findRight(nums, target)]
```

- `searchRange` is the main function that returns a list containing the first and last positions of the target.
- `findLeft` is a helper function optimized to find the left boundary of the target's position.
- `findRight` is a helper function optimized to find the right boundary of the target's position.
- In both helper functions, we maintain pointers `left` and `right` to perform the binary search. Throughout the binary search, `mid` represents the middle point between `left` and `right`.
- If `nums[mid]` is not equal to the target, we adjust the pointers in the typical binary search fashion, moving either `left` or `right`.
- If `nums[mid]` is equal to the target, for `findLeft`, we check if it is the first occurrence by comparing it with the previous element (or if it is the first element of the array). For `findRight`, we do a similar check, comparing it with the next element (or if it is the last element).
- If a boundary is not found, we return `-1`. Otherwise, we return the index of the boundary.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's demonstrate this function with a few examples:

- **Example 1**: `nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10]`, `target = 8`

For this example, `findLeft` would return `3` since `8` first appears at index `3`, and `findRight` would return `4` since that is the last occurrence of `8`. The function, therefore, returns `[3, 4]`.

- **Example 2**: `nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10]`, `target = 6`

Here, since `6` does not occur in the array, both `findLeft` and `findRight` would return `-1`, leading to `[-1, -1]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: The time complexity is `O(log n)` for both searches since each helper function performs a single binary search that has a logarithmic complexity with respect to the input size.
- Space complexity: The space complexity is `O(1)` since we only use a constant amount of extra space for variables.

### Real-World Applications

This kind of search algorithm has real-world applications wherever we have a sorted dataset, and we need to find the range of similar items quickly. For instance:

- In databases, when querying for a range of records with a specific property.
- In UI components like sliders where we need to select a range of values.
- In genomic ranges where we need to find stretches of DNA sequences.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

Common pitfalls include:

- Not considering edge cases such as the target being at the beginning or end of the array.
- Overlooking the case where the array does not contain the target.

Some tricks in implementing binary search for range finding include checking the element next to the mid-pointer to determine if we need to continue searching left or right.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The underlying pattern in this problem is the modification of binary search to perform range queries. Recognizing patterns that involve a binary search can help tackle similar problems that require searching in a sorted dataset.
