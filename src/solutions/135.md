LeetCode Problem 135 is called "Candy". Below is a comprehensive breakdown of various aspects of the problem including the problem statement, solution strategies, and analysis.

### Problem Statement

The Candy problem is a classical question that involves fair distribution while meeting certain constraints. Here's the problem statement:

There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in an integer array `ratings`. You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

The task is to calculate and return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children in a way that meets the requirements.

### Example

Input: ratings = [1, 0, 2]
Output: 5
Explanation:
- The child at index 0 gets 2 candies.
- The child at index 1 gets 1 candy.
- The child at index 2 gets 2 candies.
We have thus distributed 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 candies in total and we cannot use fewer candies and still meet our rating constraint.

### Subtle Nuances

- Notice that if two adjacent children have the same rating, they are allowed to have the same number of candies.
- The ratings are not necessarily unique which means you can have multiple children with the same rating.
- The rating criteria only apply to immediate neighbors, not to children further apart in the line.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The solution to the Candy problem can be broken down into the following key steps:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize an array, `candies`, to store the number of candies each child will get, with a size equal to the number of children, `n`, setting each element to 1 since every child gets at least one candy.

2. **Left to Right Scan**: Traverse the `ratings` array from left to right. If a child's rating is higher than the previous child's, give this child one more candy than the previous child by setting `candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1`.

3. **Right to Left Scan**: Traverse the `ratings` array from right to left. If a child's rating is higher than the next child's and the child does not already have more candies, give this child one more candy than the next child by setting `candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1)`.

4. **Sum Up Candies**: Sum up all the values in the `candies` array. This will give the minimum number of candies needed to satisfy the problem's constraints.

This approach works because it first ensures the rule that each child with a higher rating than the previous one gets more candies, and then it adjusts from the back to cover cases where a child has a higher rating than the next one.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's break down a Python implementation of the above logic:
```python
def candy(ratings):
    n = len(ratings)
    candies = [1] * n
    
    # Left to right scan
    for i in range(1, n):
        if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:
            candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1
    
    # Right to left scan
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]:
            candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1)
    
    # Summing up the candies for all children
    return sum(candies)
```

1. `candies = [1] * n`: All children are initialized to have 1 candy.
2. First `for` loop - left to right scan: If a child's rating is higher than the previous child's, they get one more candy than the `candies[i - 1]`.
3. Second `for` loop - right to left scan: If a child's rating is higher than the next child's and they have not already been given more candies from the left side, they get `max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1)`.
4. `return sum(candies)`: The total number of candies is determined by summing the `candies` array elements.

### Elaborate Examples

To ensure understanding, let's consider a few more examples:

Example 1:
ratings = [1, 2, 2]
Expected Output: 4
Explanation:
- The first child gets 1 candy.
- The second child gets 2 candies as their rating is higher.
- The third child gets 1 candy as its rating is the same as the second child's.

Example 2:
ratings = [1, 3, 4, 5, 2]
Expected Output: 11
Explanation:
- The first child gets 1 candy.
- The second child gets 2 candies.
- The third child gets 3 candies.
- The fourth child gets 4 candies.
- The fifth child gets 1 candy as its rating is less than the fourth child's.

### Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(n) where `n` is the number of children. This is because we traverse the `ratings` array only twice.

**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also O(n) due to the extra `candies` array that we use to store the candies for each child.

### Real-World Applications

The Candy problem is an abstraction of situations where resources must be allocated fairly and according to specific criteria, such as salary distribution, resource allocation, or academic grading.

### Potential Errors and Tips

A common mistake might be to use a greedy algorithm from just one direction, which will fail to satisfy the constraints for the opposite direction. Make sure to scan from both left to right and right to left.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem can be classified as a greedy algorithm problem. Recognizing that a local optimal solution leads to a global optimal solution helps in solving similar distribution or allocation problems.

Each of these problems includes elements of making local decisions that result in a global outcome, which is the essence of the greedy algorithm approach.
