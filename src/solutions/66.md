LeetCode Problem 66 is titled "Plus One." Given a non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer, this problem asks you to increment the integer by one. The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array stores a single digit. You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
The problem can be broken down into a few small steps:

1. Interpret the array of single-digit numbers as a single integer.
2. Add one to that integer.
3. Convert the resulting integer back into an array of single digits.
4. Handle any carry-over that might occur when adding one to a number that ends with a 9.

The subtle nuances in this problem lie in managing the carry. When a digit is 9, adding one to it will result in 10, meaning the current digit becomes 0, and we have to add a carry to the next significant digit. This carry might propagate to the most significant digit, and in some cases, a new digit has to be added to the array (e.g., when the array is `[9, 9]`, the result is `[1, 0, 0]`).

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
Let's walk through the different approaches:

**Iterative Approach**
- Iterate over the array starting from the least significant digit (the end of the array).
- Add one to the current digit.
- If the result is less than 10, we can simply return the modified array.
- If it is equal to 10, set that digit to 0 and continue the process for the next significant digit.
- If a carry is propagated past the most significant digit, prepend a 1 to the array.

This method is ideal because it directly confronts the problem as one of digit manipulation, exactly how the problem is presented.

**Converting to Integer**
An alternative approach could involve converting the array to an actual integer, adding one, and then converting it back to an array. However, this approach is less efficient because it ignores the efficiency of working within the digit array itself, and for very long numbers, it may lead to issues with integer overflow or precision in some languages.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
Now let's go with the iterative approach described above:

```python
def plusOne(digits):
    n = len(digits)
    
    # Start from the end of the array (least significant digit)
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        # Add one to the current digit
        digits[i] += 1
        
        # If the result is less than 10, no carry over so we return the array
        if digits[i] < 10:
            return digits
        
        # If it is 10, we have a carry over so we set the current digit to 0
        digits[i] = 0
        
    # If we are here, we had a carry from the most significant digit
    # So we need to add a new most significant digit which is 1
    return [1] + digits
```

- `n = len(digits)`: This line finds the total number of digits.
- `for i in range(n-1, -1, -1)`: This is a for loop that iterates backward through the array, from the last element to the first element.
- `digits[i] += 1`: This adds one to the current digit.
- `if digits[i] < 10`: Check if the result of the addition is less than 10. If it is, the function returns the array immediately.
- `digits[i] = 0`: If we have a carry (because the digit was 10), we set the current digit to 0.
- `return [1] + digits`: If we exit the loop and still have a carry, we need to add a new digit at the beginning of the array.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's take a look at a few example cases:

- `digits = [1, 2, 3]` → Here, adding one to the last digit doesn't cause any carry, so the result is `[1, 2, 4]`.
- `digits = [4, 3, 2, 1]` → Again, no carry is needed, so the result is `[4, 3, 2, 2]`.
- `digits = [9]` → This results in a carry that requires a new digit: `[1, 0]`.
- `digits = [9, 9, 9]` → Here, each 9 becomes a 0, and a new 1 is added at the beginning: `[1, 0, 0, 0]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
For this problem, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of digits in the input array because we may potentially have to traverse the entire array.
The space complexity is O(1) since we are modifying the array in place. However, in the worst-case scenario where we need to add a new digit at the beginning, the space complexity would be O(n + 1) = O(n), as we need space for one additional digit.

### Real-World Applications
This problem can be seen as an abstraction of many real-world scenarios where operations or transactions are done at the individual digit level, such as in reversing or increasing serial numbers, counters, or odometers.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks
A common pitfall is forgetting to handle the carry correctly, particularly when the carry affects the most significant digit. A trick to solving digit manipulation problems like these is to work from the least significant digit to the most significant digit.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem fits into the digit manipulation problem pattern, specifically relating to incrementing numerical values.
