LeetCode Problem #49 is titled "Group Anagrams." Let me break down the problem, provide a detailed solution rationale, and explain the Python code for solving this problem. Following that, I will discuss the complexity analysis, real-world applications, common pitfalls, problem-solving patterns, and related problems.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
The problem statement for "Group Anagrams" is as follows:
Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. For `strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]`, one possible grouping of anagrams could be `[["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]`.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
In order to group anagrams, we need a way to identify which strings are anagrams of each other. A common approach is to sort the characters in each string. Anagrams will become identical strings after sorting, and thus can be grouped together.

Here is a step-by-step approach to solving the problem:
1. Initialize a dictionary to map sorted strings to groups of anagrams.
2. Iterate through each string in the provided list `strs`.
3. Sort the characters of the string to serve as a key.
4. Append the original string to the list corresponding to the sorted key within the dictionary.
5. After processing all strings, the dictionary will have grouped all anagrams together.
6. Extract and return the groups from the dictionary as the final answer.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
Let's write the Python code corresponding to the strategy described above:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def groupAnagrams(strs):
    anagrams = defaultdict(list)  # Initialize a dictionary mapping a sorted tuple to a list of strings.
    
    for s in strs:  # Iterate through each string in the provided list.
        sorted_s = tuple(sorted(s))  # Sort the characters and use it as a key.
        anagrams[sorted_s].append(s)  # Group the anagrams together.
    
    return list(anagrams.values())  # Convert the grouped anagrams to a list and return.
```

Explanation:
- `from collections import defaultdict`: We're importing `defaultdict` from the `collections` library. A defaultdict will automatically initialize an empty list for a new key, saving us the trouble of checking for the key's existence.
- `anagrams = defaultdict(list)`: We create a defaultdict that will store lists of anagram groups, keyed by a sorted tuple of characters.
- `for s in strs`: We begin iterating through the input list of strings.
- `sorted_s = tuple(sorted(s))`: Sorting the characters in the string `s` and converting them into a tuple gives us a sortable, hashable key for the dictionary.
- `anagrams[sorted_s].append(s)`: We append the original string `s` to the list of anagrams corresponding to the sorted key `sorted_s`.
- `return list(anagrams.values())`: We extract and return all anagram groups as a list of lists.

### Elaborate Examples
Using the provided input `["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]`, the function would work like this:
- "eat" gets sorted to "aet" and is placed in the group keyed with "aet".
- "tea" is also sorted to "aet" and goes to the same group as "eat".
- "tan" gets sorted to "ant" and starts a new group.
- "ate" gets sorted to "aet" and is added to the "eat" and "tea" group.
- "nat" gets sorted to "ant" and goes to the same group as "tan".
- "bat" gets sorted to "abt" and starts another new group.

Finally, we would have the anagram groups:
- "aet": ["eat", "tea", "ate"]
- "ant": ["tan", "nat"]
- "abt": ["bat"]

The function returns these groups as `[['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], ['tan', 'nat'], ['bat']]`. The order within each group and the order of the groups themselves does not matter.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
1. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity primarily consists of iterating through each string and sorting it. If `k` is the maximum length of a string in `strs`, and `n` is the number of strings, the time complexity to sort each string is O(k log k). Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n * k log k).
2. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity consists of the space used to store the groups of anagrams. In the worst case where there are no anagrams, the space complexity is O(n), as every string will be in its own group.

### Real-World Applications
Grouping anagrams has practical uses in word games, like Scrabble or Boggle, where players might want to identify words that can be formed from the same set of letters. It's also a common task in text-processing and cryptography.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks
A common pitfall is not realizing that the key used for grouping must be hashable; that's why we convert the sorted list to a tuple. Additionally, the sorting operation cannot be skipped, as it's crucial to identify anagrams.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem exemplifies the usage of a hash table (or dictionary in Python) to group items with a common feature. It's a pattern of categorizing items based on a derived key, which in this case is the sorted string.

- 884. Uncommon Words from Two Sentences

Each of these problems involves anagrams or similar categorization strategies where the solution involves hashing or sorting to efficiently compare elements based on certain criteria.

In conclusion, the "Group Anagrams" problem is a classic example of a categorization problem that is solved effectively using sorting and hashing strategies. By understanding the solution to this problem, you not only learn how to efficiently group anagrams but also gain insights into other algorithms and data structures such as sorting, hashing, and the usage of dictionaries.
