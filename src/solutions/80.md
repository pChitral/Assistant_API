LeetCode Problem #80 is titled "Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II," and the problem statement is as follows:

"Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` after placing the final result in the first `k` slots of `nums`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory."

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```python
nums = [...]; # Input array
expectedNums = [...]; # The expected answer with correct length

k = removeDuplicates(nums); # Calls your implementation

assert k == len(expectedNums);
for i in range(k):
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
```

You need to implement the following function:

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums: List[int]) -> int:
```

**Example 1:**

Input: `nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]`
Output: `5`, `nums = [1,1,2,2,3, _]`
Explanation: Your function should return `k = 5`, with the first five elements of `nums` being `1, 1, 2, 2, and 3` respectively. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned `k` (hence they are underscores).

**Example 2:**

Input: `nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]`
Output: `7`, `nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3, _, _]`
Explanation: Your function should return `k = 7`, with the first seven elements being `0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, and 3` respectively. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned `k` (hence they are underscores).

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Solution Strategy:**

The goal is to modify the array in-place, such that each unique element does not appear more than twice. As the array is already sorted, duplicates will be contiguous. 

A two-pointer approach is an optimal strategy here. One pointer (`i`) iterates over the array, and another (`k`) keeps track of the position where the next non-duplicate element should be placed. 

We can iterate over `nums` starting from the second element (index 1), and compare the current element with the one at position `k - 2`. If they are different, we can safely copy the current element value to `nums[k]` and increment `k`. If they are the same, it means we have encountered more than two duplicates, and we do not increment `k`, which essentially skips the current element.

Let's translate this approach into a Python function and analyze it further. Here is a step-by-step implementation:

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if len(nums) <= 2:
        return len(nums)
    
    k = 2
    for i in range(2, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != nums[k - 2]:
            nums[k] = nums[i]
            k += 1
            
    return k
```

In this function:
- We first handle edge cases where the length of `nums` is 2 or less. In such cases, we simply return the length, as there is no need for any alterations.
- We initialize `k` to 2, because we know the first two elements are always part of the final array (since each unique element is allowed to appear twice).
- We then iterate from the third element to the end of the `nums` array.
- If the current element is different from the element at two places before the current position of `k`, we copy the current element to the `k`th position and increment `k`.
- We increment `k` only when we find an element that does not have more than two duplicates. This is the critical part of the solution.
- Finally, we return `k`, which is the number of elements after removing excessive duplicates.

**Time Complexity Analysis:**

- Each element in the array is checked exactly once, which gives us an O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in `nums`.

**Space Complexity Analysis:**

- Since the input array is modified in place and no additional data structures are used, the space complexity is O(1).

**Real-World Applications:**

- This problem can represent scenarios where you need to deduplicate entries in a log file, but still want to keep some duplicates if they occur within a certain threshold (in this case, at most twice).
- This could also be seen in database deduplication processes where certain records are allowed to have a limited number of duplicates, such as retaining only the latest two transaction records for a particular ID.

**Common Pitfalls:**

- One could mistakenly check for duplicate values by comparing `nums[i]` against `nums[k - 1]` (the previous element instead of two places back), which would incorrectly handle the case where two duplicates are allowed.
- It can be tempting to use an additional array to construct the result, but that would violate the constraint of O(1) additional space.

**Similar Problems:**

Some similar problems that you may encounter and can practice include:
- "Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II" (LeetCode #82)
- "Remove Element" (LeetCode #27)
- "Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array" (LeetCode #26), which is a simpler version of this problem where each element can only appear once.

By mastering the technique used in this problem, you'll be better equipped to deal with other array manipulation challenges where you need to modify an array in place, often using the two-pointer technique.
