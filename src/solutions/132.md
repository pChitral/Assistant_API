LeetCode Problem 132, titled "Palindrome Partitioning II," is a classic dynamic programming challenge. Let's break down every aspect of this problem to provide a comprehensive understanding and solution roadmap.

### Problem Statement:

You are given a string `s`, and the goal is to partition `s` into as few substrings as possible such that every substring is a palindrome.

Return the minimum number of cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of `s`.

### Understanding the Problem:

To solve this problem, you need to understand:

1. What a palindrome is: A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., "radar", "level".
2. What partitioning means: It refers to dividing the string into substrings. These substrings, when concatenated in the same order, will result in the original string.
3. That we're looking for the minimum cuts: This means we seek an optimal partition where the number of palindromic substrings is maximized, thereby minimizing the number of cuts.
4. A cut defines a place between two characters in the string where the string is divided. So if you have made 'n' cuts, you will end up with 'n+1' substrings.

### Examples:

- Example 1: If `s = "aab"`, one of the optimal solutions is to cut between "a" and "ab", giving us "a|ab", and since "a" and "ab" are both palindromes, we have 1 cut total.
- Example 2: If `s = "a"`, we don't need any cuts because "a" is already a palindrome.

### Solution Strategy:

This problem can be approached using dynamic programming. Here's the rationale:

1. We can create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents whether the substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome.
2. Then, we create a 1D array `cuts` where `cuts[i]` will be the minimum number of cuts needed to partition the string `s[:i+1]` into palindromic substrings.
3. We initialize `cuts[i]` with the worst case: `i` cuts which partition every character as a substring.
4. We populate `dp` using two pointers expanding around each center, checking for both even and odd length palindromes.
5. We iterate over each substring ending at index `i` and check if the substring starting from some index `j` to `i` (`s[j:i+1]`) is a palindrome. If it is, and if `j == 0`, then the whole substring `s[0:i+1]` is a palindrome, so no cut is needed; otherwise, we update `cuts[i]` with the minimum between its current value and one plus the number of cuts needed for `s[0:j]`, i.e., `cuts[i] = min(cuts[i], cuts[j-1] + 1)`.
6. The answer will be stored in `cuts[-1]`, which represents the minimum cuts for the whole string.

### Complexity Analysis:

Let's consider `n` as the length of the string `s`.

- Time Complexity: We have two nested loops to fill in the `dp` array and another two nested loops for computing `cuts`. This leads to `O(n^2)` time complexity for filling in `dp` and `O(n^2)` for computing `cuts`, resulting in an overall time complexity of `O(n^2)`.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is `O(n^2)` for the `dp` array and `O(n)` for the `cuts` array, totaling `O(n^2)`.
