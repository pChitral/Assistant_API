LeetCode Problem #1 is titled "Two Sum." Let's break down the problem statement and explore it in detail.

### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

### Inputs and Outputs
- **Input:**
  - An array of integers, `nums`.
  - An integer, `target`.

- **Output:**
  - An array of two integers, which are the indices of the two numbers in `nums` that add up to `target`.

### Constraints
The problem may also specify some constraints, such as:
1. \( 2 \leq \text{length of } \text{nums} \leq 10^{4} \)
2. \( -10^{9} \leq \text{nums}[i] \leq 10^{9} \)
3. \( -10^{9} \leq \text{target} \leq 10^{9} \)
4. Only one valid answer exists.

### Examples
Here's a simple example to illustrate the problem:

- **Input:** `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9`
- **Output:** `[0, 1]`
- **Explanation:** Since `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.

### Solution Strategy
For this problem, there are multiple approaches, and we will discuss two primary strategies:

#### 1. Brute Force Approach
The brute force approach would involve using two loops to go through each pair of numbers and checking if they add up to the target.

- Time complexity: \(O(n^2)\)
- Space complexity: \(O(1)\)

This method is not efficient for large lists because it checks every combination of numbers.

#### 2. Hash Map Approach
A more efficient approach is to use a hash map (or dictionary in Python) to store and quickly access the required complement for each number.

- Time complexity: \(O(n)\)
- Space complexity: \(O(n)\)

This method is much more efficient because it allows us to look up the complement in constant time.

### Python Code Explanation
Let's dive into the Python code using the hash map approach for this problem:

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    # Create an empty dictionary to store the potential complements
    num_dict = {}
    
    # Iterate through the list of numbers
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        # Calculate the necessary complement to reach the target
        complement = target - num
        
        # Check if the complement is already in the dictionary
        if complement in num_dict:
            # If so, return the indices of complement and current number
            return [num_dict[complement], i]
        
        # If not, store the index of the current number with its value as the key
        num_dict[num] = i
        
    # If no solution is found (this would not happen in this case as per the problem statement),
    # we should raise an exception or handle it in some way, but here it is just a placeholder for completeness.
    return None
```
- `num_dict` is used to store value-index pairs.
- `enumerate(nums)` allows us to loop over `nums` while having access to both the value (`num`) and the index (`i`).
- The `complement` is the difference between `target` and `num`.
- We check if this `complement` exists in `num_dict`. If it does, it means we have previously seen this complement's counterpart (which together with the current number adds up to the target). We return the pair of indices.
- If not, we store `num` along with its index in the dictionary for potential future complement checks.

### Complexity Analysis
Using the hash map approach:

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) because we traverse the list containing `n` elements only once. Each lookup in the table costs only \(O(1)\) time.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) in the worst case, all the elements are stored in the hash map, which contains exactly `n` elements.

### Practical Applications
This problem models a fundamental concept in computer science known as the "search for pair with a specific sum," which has various applications such as:
- Finding pairs of products that fit within a budget.
- Matching tasks in a project to meet a strict deadline based on the sum of their estimated times.
- In financial algorithms for identifying two trades which together meet a target profit or loss.

### Potential Errors and Tips
- Remember to check if the complement is the number itself and that you're not using the same element twice.
- Pay attention to the possibility of negative numbers and zero.
- Always consider that dictionary lookups are fast but not instantaneous; in cases of large datasets, even \(O(n)\) may be too slow.
