LeetCode problem number 126 is "Word Ladder II". This problem is a follow-up to "Word Ladder" and poses an additional challenge. Here's a detailed breakdown of the problem:

## Extensive Problem Breakdown:

In "Word Ladder II", you are given two words `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a list of words `wordList`. The task is to find all the shortest transformation sequences from `beginWord` to `endWord` such that:

- Only one letter can be changed at a time.
- Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that `beginWord` is not a part of the word list.
- Each sequence must be as short as possible, and you need to return all such sequences.

The subtleties in this problem lie in the constraints and the requirement to find all possible paths that are of the shortest possible length. Unlike the "Word Ladder", where you only need to find the shortest path length, here you must enumerate the actual paths.

## In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm is a natural choice as it can find the shortest path in a graph. However, since we need to find all shortest paths rather than just one, this problem requires storing additional information during the search.

A common approach is to use a BFS to build a tree-like structure storing all paths that lead to the endWord. We then perform a depth-first search (DFS) to reconstruct all these paths from the tree structure. 

### Solution Strategy:

1. **BFS Phase:** Starting from `beginWord`, perform a breadth-first search. Keep track of the tree-like structure mentioned above, where each word points back to all words that can transform into it in one step. This is essential to reconstruct the paths later.
   
2. **DFS Phase:** Once the BFS is completed and we've found the `endWord`, perform a depth-first search from `endWord` to `beginWord`, tracing back through the tree-like structure to recover all the shortest paths.

During the BFS, it's important to note that:

- We have to minimize the number of words we visit in order to reduce time complexity. We do this by generating all possible transformations of a current word and checking if they are in the `wordList`. To speed up the checking process, we can use a set instead of a list.
  
- We must avoid visiting the same word more than once, as this would create loops and inefficient paths. To ensure uniqueness, words that have already been visited are removed from the `wordList` or marked as visited.

Moreover, when we reach the `endWord`, we don't stop the BFS immediately. Instead, we finish the current level to ensure that we have found all the shortest paths.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's write the code step by step considering the above strategy. After writing the code, I'll break down each part of it providing a line-by-line explanation.

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def findLadders(beginWord, endWord, wordList):
    if endWord not in wordList:
        return []

    # Create a set for faster look-up and get word length
    wordSet = set(wordList)
    wordLength = len(beginWord)
    layer = {}
    layer[beginWord] = [[beginWord]]  # Starting point for BFS

    while layer:
        newLayer = defaultdict(list)
        for word in layer:
            if word == endWord:
                return layer[word]  # Found the shortest paths to endWord
            for i in range(wordLength):
                for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
                    nextWord = word[:i] + c + word[i+1:]
                    if nextWord in wordSet:
                        newLayer[nextWord] += [j + [nextWord] for j in layer[word]]
        
        # Remove visited words to prevent cycles and duplicates
        wordSet -= set(newLayer.keys())
        layer = newLayer
    
    return []
```

Now let's break it down:

- We start by checking if `endWord` is in `wordList`; if it's not, there's no possible transformation, so we return an empty list.
  
- We convert `wordList` to a set (`wordSet`) to make look-up operations constant time.

- We create a `layer` dict, which holds each word and all possible sequences that can reach that word. Initially, it only contains `beginWord`.

- The `while` loop represents the BFS. For each word in the current layer, we attempt to change each letter to all possible alphabets (`'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`) and check if the new word (`nextWord`) is in the `wordSet`.

- If we find the `endWord`, we return all sequences stored in `layer[endWord]`.

- For every valid `nextWord`, we append it to all sequences leading to the current `word`, forming new sequences that are added to `newLayer[nextWord]`.

- After we finish the current layer, we subtract the found words of `newLayer` from `wordSet` to avoid revisiting them, and then update `layer` to `newLayer` for the next iteration.

- If we exit the `while` loop without finding `endWord`, no valid transformation exists, so we return an empty list.

## Elaborate Examples:

Let's take an example:

```plaintext
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
```

1. Start with "hit". Possible one-letter transformations are "hot".
2. From "hot", possible transformations are "dot" and "lot".
3. From "dot", we reach "dog", and from "lot", we reach "log".
4. Finally, both "dog" and "log" can transform to "cog".

All sequences leading to "cog" are `["hit", "hot", "dot", "dog", "cog"]` and `["hit", "hot", "lot", "log", "cog"]`.

## Thorough Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N * L * 26)` where `N` is the number of words in the word list and `L` is the length of each word. For each word, we try `L` possible single-letter transformations, and each transformation involves iterating over 26 possible characters.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(N * L * W_path)` where `W_path` is the length of the longest path. We store sequences of words in the layers, and each sequence could be as long as the word path length.

## Real-World Applications:

This algorithm could be used in real-world applications involving the transformation of data in stages where each stage must follow specific rules. Examples include genetic algorithms, compiler design for optimizing intermediate code, and AI in games for pathfinding.

## Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- A common pitfall is to stop the BFS as soon as the `endWord` is found. This would not ensure all shortest paths are discovered.
  
- A trick to avoid unnecessary work is to remove words that have been visited in the current BFS layer to avoid cycles and revisitations.

- Another tip is to use a set for the word list to achieve constant-time look-ups.

## Problem Pattern Identification:

The problem follows the "Breadth-First Search" pattern for finding the shortest path and a "Backtracking/Depth-First Search" pattern to reconstruct all paths.
