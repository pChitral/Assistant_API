LeetCode problem number 63 is titled "Unique Paths II". This problem is an extension of the problem "Unique Paths", often denoted as problem number 62 on LeetCode.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem statement of "Unique Paths II" is as follows:

You are given an `m x n` grid, where each cell can have one of two values:
- `0` means the cell is empty, and you can pass through,
- `1` means the cell contains an obstacle and cannot be passed through.

The task is to find the total number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid. You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

The presence of obstacles introduces a major complication to the original "Unique Paths" problem. Here's a nuanced aspect: if the starting cell (top-left) or the destination cell (bottom-right) contains an obstacle, there are no valid paths.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. At each cell in the grid, we need to calculate the number of ways to reach that cell from the top-left corner without hitting an obstacle.

The recursive intuition is that the number of unique paths to a given cell `(i, j)` is the sum of the unique paths to the cell directly above `(i - 1, j)` and to the cell directly to the left `(i, j - 1)`, assuming those cells don't contain an obstacle.

The base cases involve the cells in the first row or first column. For the first row or the first column, if there are no obstacles, there would be only one path to each cell (all moves are either right or down, respectively). But if an obstacle is encountered, all subsequent cells in that row or column cannot be reached, and therefore the number of paths to those cells is zero.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Here's a detailed explanation of a Python solution using dynamic programming with a 2D table:

```python
def uniquePathsWithObstacles(obstacleGrid):
    m, n = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])
    # Creating a 2D DP table initialized to 0
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    # Initialize the first cell
    dp[0][0] = 1 if obstacleGrid[0][0] == 0 else 0
    
    # Initialize the first column
    for i in range(1, m):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] if obstacleGrid[i][0] == 0 else 0
        
    # Initialize the first row
    for j in range(1, n):
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] if obstacleGrid[0][j] == 0 else 0
        
    # Fill the DP table
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = 0
                
    return dp[m-1][n-1]  # The bottom-right cell contains the answer
```

Let's break this down line by line:

- `m, n = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])`: We first store the dimensions of the grid.
- `dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]`: This initializes the DP table to all zeros. The DP table is used to store the count of unique paths to reach each cell.
- We initialize `dp[0][0]`, making sure to check for an obstacle in the starting cell. If there's an obstacle, `dp[0][0]` remains `0`, indicating no paths are available.
- The first column and row are initialized similarly, with the rule that if an obstacle is encountered, all subsequent cells in that line have zero paths.
- In the nested for loops, we iterate over the cells, calculating the unique path counts using the rule mentioned earlier. If a cell is an obstacle, we explicitly set `dp[i][j]` to `0`.
- Finally, `dp[m-1][n-1]` holds the count of unique paths to the bottom-right corner, and we return this value.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's consider two examples to illustrate how the DP table is filled out:

**Example 1:**
Input: `obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]`
Output: `2`

Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the grid. The DP table would be filled out as follows:

```
1 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 2
```

**Example 2:**
Input: `obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]`
Output: `1`

Explanation: The only obstacle blocks one potential path in the first row. The DP table would be filled out as:

```
1 0
1 1
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of the solution is O(m*n) since we need to fill out the DP table once, and each cell's calculation requires constant time. The space complexity is also O(m*n) because of the 2D DP table.

We could optimize the space complexity by using a single array (1D DP table) and iterating through the grid rows, constantly updating it, reducing the space complexity to O(n).

### Real-World Applications:

This problem can be equated to real-world scenarios such as robotics, where you might need to plan a path for a robot in an environment with obstacles. Computationally, it's a classic dynamic programming problem with applications in operations research and planning algorithms.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

Pitfalls in this problem might include not correctly handling the base cases, especially not accounting for obstacles in the start and end positions or the first row and column.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

The pattern of this problem is dynamic programming with a 2D DP table and handling base cases carefully. Recognizing that you need to solve a smaller subproblem before the larger one is crucial for dynamic programming problems.
