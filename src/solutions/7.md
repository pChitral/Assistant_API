LeetCode Problem 7, titled "Reverse Integer," asks you to reverse an integer. Here is a detailed breakdown of each aspect of the problem:

### Problem Statement

Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed. If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-2³¹, 2³¹ - 1], then return 0.

### Constraints

- The input is a 32-bit signed integer. In computing, this means it can represent values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
- You must handle the overflow condition, which means if the reversed integer exceeds the 32-bit signed integer range, the function should return 0.

### Examples

Input: `x = 123`
Output: `321`

Input: `x = -123`
Output: `-321`

Input: `x = 120`
Output: `21`

Input: `x = 0`
Output: `0`

### Solution Strategy

The primary strategy to solve this problem is as follows:

1. Handle the input integer sign, which can be done by storing the sign as a separate variable and working with the absolute value of the input.
2. Reverse the integer digit by digit. This can usually be done by taking the last digit of the integer (by taking the modulus of the integer by 10), adding it to a result variable that is multiplied by 10 (to shift the previously added digits one place to the left), and then removing the last digit from the original integer by doing an integer division by 10.
3. Check for overflow. After each digit is added, ensure that the result has not exceeded the 32-bit signed integer limit.
4. Re-apply the original sign to the result before returning it.

### Edge Cases and Pitfalls

- Edge cases include handling 0, the smallest possible integer `-2,147,483,648`, which cannot be handled the same as other numbers due to the sign (its absolute value is outside the positive range of 32-bit signed integers), and numbers whose reverse would overflow.
- Common pitfalls include forgetting to reapply the original integer sign and not checking properly for overflows.

### Python Code Explanation

```python
def reverse(x: int) -> int:
    INT_MAX = 2**31 - 1
    INT_MIN = -2**31

    result = 0
    sign = 1 if x > 0 else -1
    x = abs(x)

    while x != 0:
        pop = x % 10  # Get the last digit
        x //= 10  # Remove the last digit

        # Check for overflow
        if result > INT_MAX // 10 or (result == INT_MAX // 10 and pop > 7):
            return 0
        if result < INT_MIN // 10 or (result == INT_MIN // 10 and pop < -8):
            return 0

        result = result * 10 + pop  # Add the digit to the reversed number

    return sign * result
```

Let's break down each part of this code:

- `INT_MAX` and `INT_MIN` represent the maximum and minimum possible values for a signed 32-bit integer, which are precomputed for easier checks later.
- `result` is initialized to 0, which will be our reversed number.
- `sign` is determined by checking if `x` is positive or negative.
- `x` is converted to its absolute value so that we only need to handle positive numbers while reversing.
- The while loop is used to reverse the digits of `x`. With each iteration, `pop` holds the last digit of `x`, and `x` is then divided by 10 to remove that last digit.
- After retrieving and removing the last digit, we check for overflow conditions by comparing the current `result` and the digit to be added (`pop`) against the maximum/minimum thresholds adjusted by the decimal place.
- If there is no overflow, `result` is updated by shifting its digits to the left (multiplying by 10) and adding the new digit `pop`.
- Once the loop is completed (when `x` becomes 0), we multiply the `result` by the original `sign` to regain the correct sign of the number and return it.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(log(x)), where x is the input integer. This is because the number of digits in x is proportional to log10(x), and we process each digit exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) because we use a fixed amount of space regardless of the size of the input number.

### Real-World Applications

This problem has relevance in any computational context where the manipulation of numerical values and their representations are required, such as:
- Data processing and transformations in financial computations.
- Algorithms dealing with palindromes or number symmetry in cryptography.
- Error checking mechanisms where reversals might be used to detect anomalies.
