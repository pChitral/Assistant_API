LeetCode Problem 85 is titled "Maximal Rectangle". This problem falls under the category of dynamic programming and involves a deep understanding of how to optimize the search for the largest area of a rectangle in a binary matrix.

## Problem Statement

Given a rows x cols binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

## Example

```
Input: matrix = [
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 6
Explanation: The maximal rectangle is shown in the above grid with an area of 6.
```

## Extensive Problem Breakdown

The problem can be visualized as looking for the largest rectangle consisting of contiguous 1's within a two-dimensional matrix. The rectangle can be of any size and not necessarily square. A few key points about the problem:

1. The input is a binary matrix, meaning each element is either '0' or '1'.
2. The contiguous rectangle of 1’s can be formed from both the horizontal and vertical adjacency of the ones.
3. The result should be the area of the largest rectangle found, not the rectangle itself.

This problem is akin to the largest rectangle in a histogram problem but in a two-dimensional space. The challenge lies not only in finding the rectangle but in doing so efficiently, as a straightforward approach could lead to excessive time complexity that won't satisfy the constraints of larger test cases.

## In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, a dynamic programming approach can be employed. One popular method is to enhance the 'largest rectangle in a histogram' problem solution to fit the two-dimensional nature of this problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of that strategy:

1. Prepare a 'height' array which will represent the height of histograms for each row.
2. Traverse the matrix row by row, updating the heights array. If the matrix element is '1', you increment the corresponding height, if it's '0', you reset the height to zero.
3. For each row (now converted into a histogram), use an algorithm similar to the one used for solving the 'largest rectangle in a histogram'. This usually involves a stack to keep track of the heights and their positions.
4. Keep track of the maximum area seen so far while iterating over the rows.
5. After processing all rows, the maintained maximum area will be the result.

There are other solution strategies, including:
- Brute force (Checking all possible rectangles) – Not efficient and will lead to a timeout for larger input.
- Optimized brute force with pruning – Slightly better but still not sufficient for the largest test cases.
- Divide and conquer – More complicated and doesn't necessarily provide a better time complexity than the dynamic programming approach.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation

The most efficient solution in Python employs dynamic programming and has the following components:

1. Iterate through each row to convert the '1's and '0's into integers.
2. For each row, construct and update the height histogram.
3. Apply the "largest rectangle in histogram" logic for each histogram generated.

Let's go over a detailed Python code for this approach. We will provide the complete code afterward to maintain the flow of explanation.
