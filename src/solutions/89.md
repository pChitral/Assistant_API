LeetCode Problem 89 is titled "Gray Code". The problem is part of the algorithms category and is rated as a medium difficulty problem. Let's break down the problem statement, understand the concept of Gray code, and formulate a variety of strategies to solve the problem in Python.

### Problem Statement:

The Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit (also known as a binary reflected Gray code). 

Given a non-negative integer `n` representing the total number of bits in the code, the task is to print the sequence of Gray code. A Gray code sequence must begin with 0 and must cover all 2^n possible integer values.

For example, a Gray code sequence for `n = 2` would be `[0,1,3,2]` or `[0,2,3,1]`. Both are valid sequences since each adjacent pair of values differs by exactly one bit.

### Constraints:

- `0 <= n <= 16`

### Understanding Gray Code:

A Gray code sequence for `n` bits is a sequence of 2^n integers where:

- The first integer is 0.
- Each subsequent integer differs from the previous integer by exactly one bit.
- The sequence covers all 2^n unique binary configurations.

It's important to note that for an `n`-bit Gray code, there are multiple valid solutions, as the problem states that any permutation of the sequence that satisfies the requirements is acceptable.

### Solution Rationale:

One way to generate a Gray code sequence is to start with the base case where `n = 0`, which is a sequence `[0]`. As you increase `n`, you can build on the Gray code sequence for `n - 1` by reflecting the sequence, prefixing the original sequence with `0` and the reflected sequence with `1`, and concatenating them to form the new sequence.

### Python Code Explanation:

We could implement this recursively or iteratively. Here's how we could define a function to solve it recursively:

```python
def grayCode(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    else:
        prev_gray = grayCode(n-1)
        return prev_gray + [x + (1 << (n-1)) for x in reversed(prev_gray)]
```

Let's go through this code step by step:

1. Base Case: If `n` is `0`, we return the base case `[0]`.
2. Recursive Case: We calculate Gray code for `n-1` and store it in `prev_gray`.
3. The new sequence for Gray code of `n` is formed by taking `prev_gray` (prefixing these numbers with a `0` bit which does not change their value) and appending the reflected version of `prev_gray` with a `1` bit prefix. The `(1 << (n-1))` shifts a `1` to the correct place value to create the prefix.
4. The list comprehension `x + (1 << (n-1)) for x in reversed(prev_gray)` effectively adds `1` as the most significant bit to each number in the reversed `prev_gray`.

### Example:

Let's generate a Gray code sequence for `n = 2`:

1. For `n = 0`, the sequence is `[0]`.
2. For `n = 1`, we reflect `[0]` to get `[0]` again, prefix original with `0` to get `[0]` and prefix the reflection with `1` to get `[1]`. Concatenating these lists gets `[0, 1]`.
3. For `n = 2`, reflecting `[0, 1]` gives `[1, 0]`, prefixing with `0` gives `[00, 01]` (which is `[0, 1]` in decimal) and prefixing the reflection with `1` gives `[11, 10]` which is `[3, 2]` in decimal. Concatenating these lists gets `[0, 1, 3, 2]`.

### Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: O(2^n), as we are generating every possible configuration of n bits exactly once.
- Space Complexity: O(2^n), which is required for the output list.

### Real-World Applications:

Gray codes are used in various applications, for example:

- Position encoders, where the position is converted into a Gray code so that only one bit changes at a time, minimizing error.
- In error correction and digital communications, Gray codes can be used to prevent spurious output from transitions between states.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Ensure that the sequence starts with `0`.
- Understand that the problem expects a sequence of integers, not a list of binary strings.
- Be cautious with the bit manipulation when reversing and concatenating the Gray code sequences.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

The problem is a classic example of recursion and bit manipulation. Recognizing the pattern of the problem helps in solving similar problems that involve generating combinatorial objects based on certain constraints.
