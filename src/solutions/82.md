LeetCode Problem 82 is titled "Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II," and here is a comprehensive breakdown of the problem along with an in-depth analysis and solution strategy. 

### Problem Breakdown

The problem states that you are given the head of a sorted linked list, where some elements may be repeated. Your task is to delete all nodes that have duplicates, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. The returned list should also be sorted.

#### Subtle Nuances
- The linked list is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
- We are not just removing duplicate nodes but also the nodes that have appeared more than once. This means that if a value appears multiple times in the list, all instances of that value should be removed from the list completely.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The key to solving this problem lies in understanding how to traverse a linked list while keeping track of duplicates. Since the list is sorted, all duplicates will be adjacent. There are a few methods to approach this problem:

#### Method 1: Sentinel Head + Predecessor

Since the head of the list can also be a duplicate and thus removed, it is often easier to start with a fake "sentinel" node whose next pointer points to the head of the list. Here's the step-by-step strategy using this method:

1. Initialize a sentinel node and a predecessor pointer which points to this sentinel node.
2. Traverse the list with a current pointer.
3. Check for duplicates by comparing the current node's value to the value of the next node.
4. Continue moving forward as long as there are duplicates.
5. Once you reach the end of duplicates, point the predecessor's next to the current's next, effectively removing the duplicates.
6. Move the predecessor pointer only if no duplicates were found.

#### Method 2: Recursive Approach

The recursive approach will process the list from back to front:
1. Recur until you find the last node or a node that is different from its next node (i.e., not a duplicate).
2. On the way back from recursion, decide whether to keep or discard each node based on whether it is a duplicate.

Both methods essentially do the same work but differ in how they traverse and handle the nodes.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Below is a Python function implementing the Sentinel Head + Predecessor method, as it's easier to visualize for those unfamiliar with recursion.

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def deleteDuplicates(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    sentinel = ListNode(0, head)
    predecessor = sentinel

    while head
