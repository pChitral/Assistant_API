LeetCode problem number 114 is titled "Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List". This problem requires you to flatten a binary tree into a linked list in-place. The linked list should use the right child pointers and the left child pointers should all be null. The ordering should be the same as the pre-order traversal of the binary tree.

Let's break this problem down in detail before presenting a solution strategy.

### Problem Statement:
Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":
- The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.
- The linked list should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.
  
Here's an example of the problem statement:

Given binary tree:
```plaintext
    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6
```

The flattened tree should look like:
```plaintext
1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6
```

### Solution Rationale:
To flatten the tree, there are several methods you might consider:

1. Recursion (DFS):
   - Traverse the tree using depth-first search (DFS), specifically in a pre-order fashion (node → left → right).
   - While traversing, we reconstruct the tree by:
     - Flattening the left subtree and the right subtree.
     - Setting the current node's right child to the flattened left subtree.
     - Appending the flattened right subtree to the end of the flattened left subtree.
     - Setting the left child to `null`.
     
2. Iterative Approach:
   - Start from the root and process nodes iteratively.
   - You can perform a modified pre-order traversal that flattens the tree as you go.

3. Morris Traversal (Threaded Binary Tree):
   - This is an in-place tree traversal algorithm that does not require recursion or a stack.
   - The idea is to create a temporary link called a "thread" from the rightmost node back to the current node.

4. Stack-based DFS:
   - Utilize a stack to simulate the recursive DFS behavior.
   - This method also involves a pre-order style traversal, flattening the tree iteratively.

### Python Code Explanation:
In this example, I'll provide a recursive DFS solution in Python due to its simplicity and intuitive alignment with the problem's requirements. Here's a step-by-step code walkthrough:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def flatten(self, root: TreeNode) -> None:
        if not root:
            return None
        
        # Flatten the left and right subtrees
        self.flatten(root.left)
        self.flatten(root.right)
        
        # Store the flattened right subtree to reconnect it later
        temp_right = root.right
        # Reconnect the flattened left subtree to the right
        root.right = root.left
        root.left = None  # Set the left child to None
        
        # Find the end of the new right subtree and reconnect the original right subtree
        while root.right:
            root = root.right
        root.right = temp_right
```

### Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(N), as we visit each node exactly once, where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
- Space Complexity: O(H), where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case of a skewed tree, the space complexity would be O(N).

### Real-World Applications:
This problem can be related to the in-memory representation of hierarchical data structures, which might need to be flattened for serialization, database storage, or network transmission.

### Potential Pitfalls and Tips:
- Do not create new nodes; the problem requires you to use the existing nodes and simply rearrange the pointers.
- Make sure to handle the left subtree before the right subtree because we need to place the flattened left subtree before the right one.
- Remember to set the left pointers of all nodes to `null`.
