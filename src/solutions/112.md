LeetCode problem number 112 is titled "Path Sum". This problem falls under the Tree category, and it is considered an easy problem in terms of difficulty. Here is a detailed breakdown of the problem, including its statement, solution rationale, code explanation, examples, complexity analysis, real-world applications, common pitfalls, related problems, and problem-solving patterns.

### Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the target sum.

A *leaf* is a node with no children.

Here's the struct definition of a binary tree node provided in the problem:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

### Input and Output Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
Output: true
```
Explanation: The path with the sequence [5,4,11,2] sums up to 22.

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
Output: false
```
Explanation: There are two root-to-leaf paths: [1,2] and [1,3]. Neither of them add up to 5.

**Example 3:**
```
Input: root = [], targetSum = 0
Output: false
```
Explanation: Since the tree is empty, there's no path, so the answer is false.

### Solution Rationale

The problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) traversal. Starting from the root of the binary tree, you can recursively check each path, subtracting the current node's value from the target sum until you reach a leaf node. When a leaf node is encountered, check if the remaining target sum equals the leaf node's value. If it does, that means a path sum equal to the target exists.

There are two recursive cases in this traversal:
1. If the current node is not a leaf, recursively visit its non-null children with an updated target sum.
2. If the current node is a leaf, check if the target sum is equal to the value of the current node.

The base case for the recursion is when you reach a null node (essentially falling off the tree), in which case, there is no path, so you return false.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

```python
def hasPathSum(root, targetSum):
    # Base case: if the root is None, no path exists
    if not root:
        return False
        
    # If we reach a leaf node, check if the remaining targetSum equals the node's value
    if not root.left and not root.right:
        return root.val == targetSum
        
    # Recursively call on the left and right subtree with updated targetSum
    left = hasPathSum(root.left, targetSum - root.val)
    right = hasPathSum(root.right, targetSum - root.val)
    
    # Return true if either the left or right subtree has a path sum that equals targetSum
    return left or right
```

#### Line-by-Line Explanation:

- `def hasPathSum(root, targetSum):` defines the function with a tree node `root` and an integer `targetSum`.
  
- `if not root: return False` is the base case checking for an empty tree (null node), in which case it returns False since there's no path.

- `if not root.left and not root.right: return root.val == targetSum` checks if the current node is a leaf (no left or right child) and returns True if the value of the node equals the remaining target sum, indicating a valid path has been found.

- `left = hasPathSum(root.left, targetSum - root.val)` recursively calls the same function for the left subtree while subtracting the current node's value from `targetSum`.

- `right = hasPathSum(root.right, targetSum - root.val)` does the same for the right subtree.

- `return left or right` will return True if either the left or right recursive call found a valid path sum. If neither subtree has a path sum that equals `targetSum`, the function will ultimately return False.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's consider a binary tree `[1, 2]` with `targetSum = 3`. The function `hasPathSum` is called with the root node (val=1).

Here are the steps of execution:

1. The current node 1 is not null, and it's not a leaf, so we continue.
2. We recursively call `hasPathSum` on node 2 with `targetSum` updated to 2 (3 - 1).
3. The node 2 is a leaf. We check if its value equals the updated `targetSum` (which it does), and return True.
4. Since the left subtree returned True, the initial call also returns True.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we potentially have to visit every node once to check all paths.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This stems from the maximum depth of the recursive call stack. For a balanced tree, this would be O(log n), but in the worst case (a skewed tree), it could be O(n).

### Real-World Applications

The "Path Sum" problem can be related to various real-world scenarios involving hierarchical structures where we want to determine if a cumulative sum along a certain path reaches a specific value. Examples include:
- Evaluating budget allocations in organizational structures.
- Summing up costs in a product component tree where each node represents a part contributing to the total cost.
- Analyzing energy consumption in a network of connected systems.

### Common Pitfalls

- Neglecting to handle edge cases, such as an empty tree or trees with only one node.
- Not properly identifying a leaf node (a common mistake is to check only one child instead of both).
- Not correctly updating the `targetSum` during the recursive calls.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem is an example of the Depth-First Search (DFS) approach for tree traversal. Recognizing that we can use a recursive algorithm to explore each root-to-leaf path is key in solving this and similar problems.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems

Other problems that involve similar traversal and path-sum concepts include:
- LeetCode #113 (Path Sum II) — find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.
- LeetCode #129 (Sum Root to Leaf Numbers) — compute the sum of all numbers formed by root-to-leaf paths.
- LeetCode #437 (Path Sum III) — find the number of paths that sum to a given value (the paths do not need to start at the root and end at a leaf).

Each of these problems can build upon the skills learned in solving the "Path Sum" problem, expanding the understanding of tree traversal and recursive algorithms in various scenarios.
