LeetCode Problem 65 is titled "Valid Number." The problem deals with validating if a given string is a representation of a numerical value. Here's a detailed explanation of the problem, along with its various nuances:

### **Problem Statement**

You are given a string `s` and are required to determine if `s` can be interpreted as a decimal number. This means that the string must conform to the standards that are generally accepted for decimal numbers.

### **Specifics to consider:**

1. **Numeric characters**: The characters `0` through `9` are the standard numeric characters.

2. **Exponentiation character**: The character `e` or `E` can indicate that what follows is an exponent in scientific notation. For example, `3e2` means `3 * 10^2` which equals `300`.

3. **Decimal points**: A decimal point `.` may appear to indicate a fractional component of the number. For instance, `3.5` translates to `three plus one-half`.

4. **Sign characters**: Plus `+` or minus `-` signs may precede numbers to indicate their sign. The 'e' or 'E' can also be preceded by a sign to indicate the sign of the exponent, as in `3e+2`.

5. **Whitespace**: Whitespace characters are not allowed within the number, but it could appear before or after the number.

6. **Leading or trailing zeros**: They are allowed, as in `0042` or `42.00`.

7. **Leading or trailing decimal point**: A number can start or end with a decimal point, as in `.42` or `42.`.

8. **Scientific notation**: A number can be in the form of scientific notation, as in `42e2`, which is a valid number.

9. **Invalid characters**: Any other character besides these is not considered valid within a number.

### **Requirements for a Valid Number**

A valid number must adhere to the following constraints:

- It may or may not start with a `+` or `-`.
- It may contain one or more numeric characters.
- It may contain a decimal point, but if it does, there must be numeric characters either before or after it, or both.
- It may contain an `e` or `E` character to indicate scientific notation, but:
  - It must have numeric characters before the `e` or `E`.
  - It may have a sign character immediately after the `e` or `E`, followed by one or more numeric characters.

### **Clarifications**

The following are some clarifications for what does **not** constitute a valid number:

- Purely alphabetical strings (e.g., "abc").
- Numbers with multiple decimal points (e.g., "1.2.3").
- Numbers with multiple `e` characters (e.g., "1e2e3").
- Exponential notation without a preceding number (e.g., "e3").
- Exponential notation without following numbers (e.g., "3e").
- Leading or trailing whitespace within the numeric component (e.g., " 1 ").

### **Approach to the Solution**

To solve this problem, one needs to implement a finite state machine (FSM) or a set of strict validation rules that a string must pass to be considered a valid number based on the above constraints.

A common strategy is to iterate through the string character by character, keeping track of what has been seen. For instance:

- Has a numeric character been encountered?
- Has a decimal point been seen, and if so, where was it relative to numeric characters?
- Has an exponent been seen, and what was the format of the number around it?

### **Examples**

Valid examples:
- `"2"` is a valid number.
- `"0089"` is a valid number with leading zeroes.
- `"-0.1"` is a valid negative decimal.
- `"+3.14"` is a valid positive decimal with a sign.
- `"4."` is a valid number with a trailing decimal point.
- `"-3E-2"` is a valid negative scientific notation number with a decimal exponent.

Invalid examples:
- `"abc"` is not a valid number.
- `"1a"` is not a valid number.
- `"1e"` is not a valid number due to the incomplete exponential notation.
- `"e3"` starts with an exponent and contains no numbers.
- `"99e2.5"` is not valid because the exponent contains a decimal point.

### **Complexity Analysis**

The complexity analysis generally involves:
- **Time Complexity**: This is usually O(n), where n is the length of the string since we typically need to scan through all characters.
- **Space Complexity**: This is usually O(1) since the solution should operate with a constant amount of extra space, only keeping track of certain flags or state variables.

### **Practical Applications**

Knowing how to validate a numerical string is important in various applications, such as user input validation, data sanitization before database insertion, or preprocessing data for scientific computation where the format of numbers is essential.

### **Common Pitfalls and Tricks**

- Paying close attention to the edge cases involving signs, decimal points, and exponent notation is important.
- Simplifying the problem by trimming the input string can help to deal with whitespace without complicating the core logic.
- Using regular expressions can sometimes provide a quick and effective solution, but might not be as efficient as FSM implementations.

### **Problem-solving Pattern**

This problem falls under the general category of string parsing and finite state machines. Recognizing patterns within the string and handling each character based on the current state of our parsed number is generic to many problems involving complex string validations.

### **Linked Problems**

While they differ in specifics, the fundamental approach of parsing a string input based on certain rules or states can be applied in solving them as well.
