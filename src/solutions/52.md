LeetCode Problem 52 is titled "N-Queens II". This problem is a follow-up to the N-Queens problem, where the challenge is to find all distinct solutions to the N-Queens puzzle, but in this case, you are only asked to return the number of distinct solutions instead of listing them all.

Here is the problem statement:

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n×n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n queens, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

### Problem Breakdown:
- The puzzle is played on an n×n chessboard.
- You have n queens to place on this board.
- No two queens should be able to attack each other, meaning:
  - No two queens can be placed on the same row.
  - No two queens can be placed on the same column.
  - No two queens can be placed on the same diagonal.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
To solve this problem, you can take a similar approach as with the N-Queens I problem by using backtracking. The backtracking algorithm will place a queen on the board and then move to the next row to place another queen. At each step, you need to ensure that the newly placed queen is not in conflict with the already placed queens. The process repeats until all queens are placed on the board or until it is determined that no valid position is available for the next queen, at which point the algorithm backtracks.

The primary difference between N-Queens I and N-Queens II is that in the former, you needed to generate all possible board configurations, while in the latter, you only need to count the number of such valid configurations. Therefore, you do not need to store the board states, which reduces space complexity.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Let's break down the Python code that implements the backtracking approach to solve this problem. 

Firstly, we need to define the function `totalNQueens` that accepts an integer `n`:
```python
def totalNQueens(n: int) -> int:
    def can_place(row, col):
        # Some logic to check if a queen can be placed at this row & col
        pass

    def backtrack(row):
        # Some logic to place the next queen
        pass

    return backtrack(0)
```

Within `totalNQueens`, we have two nested functions, `can_place` and `backtrack`. `can_place` is responsible for checking whether a queen can be placed in a given row and column without conflict. `backtrack` will use `can_place` to try placing queens on the board and backtrack if needed. Finally, we start the backtracking process with `backtrack(0)` by trying to place the first queen in the first row.

Let's fill in the `can_place` function:
```python
def can_place(row, col):
    # Check column
    for i in range(row):
        if board[i] == col or \
           board[i] - i == col - row or \
           board[i] + i == col + row:
            return False
    return True
```

In this function, `board` is a list that we will define in `totalNQueens` to keep track of where queens are placed. `board[i]` denotes the column position of the queen in the `i`-th row.

Now, let's implement the `backtrack` function:
```python
def backtrack(row):
    if row == n:
        return 1  # All queens are placed. Found a solution.
    count = 0
    for col in range(n):
        if can_place(row, col):
            board[row] = col
            count += backtrack(row + 1)
            # No need to remove the queen, just try the next placement.
    return count
```

The `backtrack` function tries to place a queen in each column of the current row, and if it's successful, recursively calls itself to place a queen in the next row. If `row == n`, it means queens are successfully placed, and we have found one distinct solution, so we return 1. For each row, we keep a count of the number of solutions found by recursive calls.

Now let's put it all together:
```python
def totalNQueens(n: int) -> int:
    def can_place(row, col):
        for i in range(row):
            if board[i] == col or \
               board[i] - i == col - row or \
               board[i] + i == col + row:
                return False
        return True

    def backtrack(row):
        if row == n:
            return 1
        count = 0
        for col in range(n):
            if can_place(row, col):
                board[row] = col
                count += backtrack(row + 1)
        return count

    board = [-1] * n
    return backtrack(0)
```

In the above code, `board` is initialized with -1 indicating no queens are placed yet. The function `totalNQueens` then returns the total number of solutions by starting the backtracking process.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n!), because we are trying to place queens one by one and there are n choices for the first queen, n-1 choices for the second, and so on. However, the actual time complexity might be better due to early rejections in cases when two queens threaten each other.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), since we are using a single list to store the `board` state. The additional space for the call stack is also O(n), because the maximum depth of the recursion is n. 

Real-World Applications:
The N-Queens problem is a classic example of a constraint satisfaction problem, which is prevalent in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, scheduling, and game development. It teaches concepts that can be applied in real-world applications where various constraints need to be satisfied while making certain decisions.

Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- One common pitfall is not handling the diagonals correctly when checking if placing a queen is valid.
- Another pitfall is forgetting to count the number of solutions, instead of directly returning when a solution is found. 
- A trick that can be used is to represent diagonals mathematically to reduce the need for complex data structures.

Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem is a classic example of backtracking where you build up a solution incrementally and abandon it ("backtrack") as soon as it is determined that the solution is not viable ("reject").
