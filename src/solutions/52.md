LeetCode Problem 52 is titled "N-Queens II". It's a follow-up to the classic N-Queens problem (Problem 51). The goal of the N-Queens problems is to place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, there must be no two queens that share the same row, column, or diagonal.

### Problem Statement

The N-Queens II problem asks for the number of distinct solutions to place N queens on an N×N chessboard without any queens attacking each other. Unlike N-Queens I, which requires all the board configurations as the output, N-Queens II only asks for the total count of such configurations.

Here's some additional context about the problem:

- The input is an integer `n`, which represents both the number of queens and the size of the chessboard (n×n).

- The output is an integer representing the number of distinct solutions.

- You are guaranteed that the answer will always fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

### Solution Rationale

The N-Queens problem is a classic problem for backtracking algorithms, which are a form of recursive algorithm used to solve constraint satisfaction problems. Here's the high-level idea of how a backtracking algorithm might solve N-Queens II:

1. Start from the leftmost column of the board.
2. If all queens are placed, then a solution has been found.
3. Try all rows in the current column. Do the following for every tried row:
   - If the queen can be placed safely in this row, mark this cell and recursively check if placing a queen here leads to a solution.
   - If placing the queen in the current row and proceeding to place further queens leads to a solution, return true.
   - If placing the queen doesn't lead to a solution, unmark this cell (backtrack) and go to step 3 to try other rows.
4. If all rows have been tried and nothing worked, return false to trigger backtracking.

In the case of N-Queens II, since we're only interested in the count of distinct solutions rather than the solutions themselves, we can modify the algorithm to increment a counter every time all queens are placed successfully.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's write Python code for the backtracking algorithm and explain it line by line:

```python
def totalNQueens(n):
    def can_place(row, col):
        for prev_row in range(row):
            if board[prev_row] == col or \
               prev_row - board[prev_row] == row - col or \
               prev_row + board[prev_row] == row + col:
                return False
        return True

    def backtrack(row):
        nonlocal count
        for col in range(n):
            if can_place(row, col):
                board[row] = col
                if row == n - 1:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    backtrack(row + 1)

    count = 0
    board = [-1] * n
    backtrack(0)
    return count
```

- `totalNQueens(n)`: This is the main function that takes an integer `n` and initializes the backtracking algorithm.

- `can_place(row, col)`: A helper function to check whether it is safe to place a queen at the given `row` and `col`. It checks whether any previous row has a queen in the same column or on the same diagonal.

- The two diagonal checks are done by checking if the difference or sum of the row numbers and column numbers are equal, as queens on the same diagonal will have equal row-col difference or row+col sum.

- `backtrack(row)`: A recursive function to try placing a queen on every row. It calls the `can_place` function for each column in the current row. If the queen can be placed safely, it sets the corresponding entry in the `board` array, indicating the queen's column, then moves on to place the next queen by a recursive call to `backtrack(row + 1)`.

- If a solution is found (a queen is placed on the last row), the `count` variable is incremented.

- The `count` variable is defined as nonlocal in order to modify it within the nested `backtrack` function.

- The `backtrack(0)` call starts the backtracking process from the first row.

- Finally, `return count` returns the total number of distinct solutions.

### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N!), where N is the number of queens and the size of the board. Although the backtracking algorithm significantly reduces the search space by pruning the tree, in the worst case (especially with larger values of N), it might still need to explore almost every configuration.

The space complexity is O(N) due to the board and the system's call stack used for recursion.

### Real-World Applications

The N-Queens problem, especially in its algorithmic approach, is an example of how computational thinking can be applied to solve problems that seem purely theoretical. It has real-world applications in scheduling, constraint optimization, and planning systems where the goal is to find solutions that satisfy a set of constraints.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

A common pitfall is not considering both diagonals properly in the `can_place` function. It's crucial to check both the primary and secondary diagonals when determining if a position is under attack.

Another tip is to utilize bitwise operations for further optimization, representing the columns and diagonals as bits. This is an advanced technique and can significantly improve the performance for larger boards.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The N-Queens problem is an example of a backtracking problem, a pattern where an exhaustive search is necessary but can be optimized by eliminating paths that lead to violation of constraints.
