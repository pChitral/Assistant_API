LeetCode problem number 3 is titled "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters." The problem statement is as follows:

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

In this problem, a substring is defined as a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. The goal is to find the longest such sequence that contains no repeating characters. It's crucial to note that substrings are different from subsequences in that they must be continuous; characters cannot be skipped over.

Subtleties in the problem statement include understanding the definition of a repeating character—any character that appears more than once in the substring—and the requirement that the characters within the substring must be unique.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The naive approach to this problem would involve generating all possible substrings and checking each one for uniqueness, which would lead to an O(n^2) or O(n^3) time complexity solution, rendering it inefficient for large strings.

A more efficient approach is the sliding window technique. This technique uses two pointers to create a window that can be expanded and contracted. Here's how you can use it:

1. Initialize two pointers, start and end, keeping track of the current window's boundaries.
2. Use a set or a hash map to track the characters in the current window.
3. Expand the end pointer to the right and add characters to the set until a repeat character is found.
4. When a repeat character is encountered, record the current window's length if it is the longest so far.
5. Move the start pointer to the right to shrink the window, removing characters from the set until the repeat character is removed.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the end pointer has gone through the entire string.

The sliding window approach ensures that we only examine each character in the string once, leading to an O(n) time complexity.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's implement the sliding window algorithm in Python:

```python
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: str) -> int:
    char_set = set()  # This will store unique characters of the current window
    max_length = 0  # The maximum length of the substring without repeating characters
    start = 0  # The starting index of the current window

    for end in range(len(s)):
        # If the character is already in the set, we remove the earliest character in the set until it's gone
        while s[end] in char_set:
            char_set.remove(s[start])
            start += 1
        # Add the character to the set and update the max_length if possible
        char_set.add(s[end])
        max_length = max(max_length, end - start + 1)

    return max_length
```

### Elaborate Examples

Let's apply the solution to Example 3 "pwwkew":

1. Initialize empty character set, `max_length = 0`, `start = 0`.
2. `end = 0`, character 'p', add 'p' to set: `char_set = {'p'}`, `max_length = 1`.
3. `end = 1`, character 'w', add 'w' to set: `char_set = {'p', 'w'}`, `max_length = 2`.
4. `end = 2`, character 'w', already in set. We remove from start until 'w' is no longer in the set:

   - Remove 'p', `start = 1`, `char_set = {'w'}`
   - Since we are looking at 'w' and it's already in set, no need to remove more. Add 'w' (second one): `char_set = {'w', 'w'}` (In reality, it's still a set, so the 'w' is not duplicated)

5. `end = 3`, character 'k', add 'k' to set: `char_set = {'w', 'k'}`, `max_length = 3`.
6. `end = 4`, character 'e', add 'e' to set: `char_set = {'w', 'k', 'e'}`, `max_length = 3`.
7. `end = 5`, character 'w' is in set, remove from start until 'w' is not in set:

   - Remove 'w', `start = 2`, `char_set = {'k', 'e'}`
   - Now 'w' is not in set anymore, add 'w': `char_set = {'k', 'e', 'w'}`, `max_length = 3`.

The loop ends and the longest substring without repeat characters is "wke" with length 3.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. Each character is looked at exactly twice: once when expanding the end pointer and once when moving the start pointer. The space complexity is O(min(n, m)), where m is the size of the character set used in the string (in the ASCII case it is constant 128, for Unicode it could be larger). This is due to the additional set used to store the characters, which in the worst case, stores all unique characters in the string.

### Real-World Applications

This problem represents a common task in text processing and parsing, where it might be necessary to find a unique sequence of characters or tokens. For example, in tokenizing for a compiler, ensuring a variable name is not duplicated within the same scope could be similar to this problem.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

One common pitfall is forgetting to update the `max_length` after each iteration, or incorrectly updating it inside the inner while loop, which could cause an incorrect result if a character is added to the `char_set` without checking the length of the current substring.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The sliding window pattern is crucial for solving problems where you're asked to find continuous substrings or subarrays that meet certain criteria. Recognizing this as a sliding-window problem is key to devising an efficient solution.
