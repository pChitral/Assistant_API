LeetCode Problem #40 is titled "Combination Sum II". Let me give you a comprehensive analysis and explanation of this problem.

## Extensive Problem Breakdown

In this problem, you are given a collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target). The task is to find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sum to the target.

Each number in candidates may only be used once in the combination. It's important to note that the solution set must not include duplicate combinations.

Here are the main points to understand:
- The same number can be chosen from candidates multiple times, but each number is unique within a particular combination.
- The order of numbers within a combination does not matter; `[2,3,6]` and `[3,2,6]` are considered the same combination and therefore only one should be included in the solution.
- The candidates array may contain duplicates.
- The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
- The candidate numbers can be in any order, and it doesn't matter which order you use to achieve the target sum.

## In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, we need to explore all possible combinations of candidate numbers that sum up to the target. However, to avoid duplicates we have to sort the array first and then skip over duplicate elements during the combination construction.

A common approach suitable for this problem is to use backtracking. This is a method of solving computational problems by incrementally building candidates to the solutions and abandoning candidates ("backtracking") as soon as it is determined that they cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

### Steps for the Backtracking Approach:

1. Sort the candidate array to handle duplicates easily.
2. Create a recursive function that takes the current combination, the current sum, the remaining candidates, and the current starting index.
3. If the current sum is equal to the target, add the current combination to the result list.
4. Iterate through the remaining candidates, starting from the current index. For each candidate:
   - Skip duplicates.
   - Include the current candidate in the current combination.
   - Recurse with the remaining candidates and the updated current sum.
   - "Backtrack" by removing the current candidate from the current combination.
5. The base case for the recursion is when the current sum is equal to the target.

This approach ensures that we explore each unique set of numbers that could potentially sum up to the target, while skipping over duplicates to avoid the same combination being considered more than once.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's implement the backtracking approach in Python:

```python
def combinationSum2(candidates, target):
    def backtrack(start, target, path):
        if target == 0:
            result.append(path)
            return
        for i in range(start, len(candidates)):
            if i > start and candidates[i] == candidates[i-1]:  # skip duplicates
                continue
            if candidates[i] > target:  # early stop
                break
            backtrack(i + 1, target - candidates[i], path + [candidates[i]])

    candidates.sort()  # sort the array to handle duplicates
    result = []
    backtrack(0, target, [])
    return result
```

Let's break down the code above:

- We first sort `candidates` to ensure that duplicates are next to each other and can be easily skipped.
- `result` is the list that will hold all of our unique combinations.
- The `backtrack` function is a helper function defined within `combinationSum2`. It is used to generate combinations recursively.
    - `start` is the index at which to start considering candidates to avoid reusing elements.
    - `target` is the remaining sum we need to achieve.
    - `path` is the current combination being constructed.
- If the `target` becomes `0`, it means the current `path` sums up to the desired target, so we add a copy of `path` to `result`.
- We loop through `candidates` starting from the `start` index to avoid duplicates.
    - If the value at index `i` is the same as the previous value (and it's not the start index), we `continue` to skip it.
    - If the value at index `i` is greater than the remaining `target`, we can `break` from the loop since the candidates are sorted and further values will also be too big.
    - Otherwise, we call `backtrack` recursively, passing `i+1` as the new start index, `target - candidates[i]` as the new target, and `path + [candidates[i]]` as the new path including the current candidate.

## Elaborate Examples

Let's look at a detailed example:

Suppose we have:
- `candidates = [10, 1, 2, 7, 6, 1, 5]`
- `target = 8`

And we expect:
- `result = [[1, 1, 6], [1, 2, 5], [1, 7], [2, 6]]`

Here's what happens behind the scenes:
1. Sort `candidates` to `[1, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 10]`.
2. Start with an empty `path` and target `8`.
3. Try `1`, which leads to `[1]`, target becomes `7`.
4. Recurse, and try another `1`, but avoid the duplicate. Continue with `2`, which leads to `[1, 2]`, target becomes `5`.
5. Keep recursing and finding valid combinations, making sure to skip duplicates and not use elements beyond the target.

Through this backtracking approach, we systematically explore each candidate, backtrack when necessary, and ensure we account for each unique combination that sums to `target`.

## Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(2^N) in the worst case, where N is the length of the candidates array. This complexity arises because for each candidate, we have two choices: either include it in the current combination or exclude it, forming a binary choice tree.

The space complexity is O(N) because, in the worst case, the recursion stack could go as deep as the number of elements in `candidates`, plus the space needed for storing the current combination.

## Real-World Applications

Problems like "Combination Sum II" have real-world applications in areas such as financial computations (for instance, finding all possible combinations of transactions that sum to a specific amount), resource allocation, constraint satisfaction problems in artificial intelligence, and many other domains where a specific set of conditions must be met without redundancy.

## Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Duplicate handling is critical. You must sort the array and be careful about skipping over duplicates.
- It is inefficient to generate all combinations and then filter for unique ones; much better to avoid creating duplicates from the start.
- Remember to 'backtrack' properly by undoing any changes made before the recursive call when you return from it.

## Problem Pattern Identification

The pattern recognized in this problem is backtracking. It is useful for decision-making problems where constraints need to be satisfied, and is commonly used in constraint satisfaction, permutations, combinations, and subset problems.
