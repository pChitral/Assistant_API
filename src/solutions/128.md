LeetCode problem number 128 is "Longest Consecutive Sequence". This problem is all about finding the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. Below is the problem description along with an exhaustive explanation.

### Problem Description
Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, you need to return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

### Example
```
Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

### Constraints
- `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

### Solution Strategy
The key insight to solve this problem in `O(n)` complexity is to use a Hash Table (which in Python is implemented as a `dict`). The traditional sorting approach would take `O(nlogn)` due to the sort operation, which does not meet the complexity requirement.

#### Steps
1. Insert all the numbers from the array into a `set` to eliminate duplicates and to allow `O(1)` lookups.
2. Iterate over each number in the `nums` array and for each number that is the start of a new sequence (i.e., the number that doesn't have its previous number in the set), start counting the length of the sequence by incrementing a counter while the consecutive numbers are in the set.
3. Update the maximum length found so far.

### Python Code Explanation
```python
def longestConsecutive(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    num_set = set(nums)
    max_length = 0

    for num in num_set:
        # Check if it's the start of a sequence
        if num - 1 not in num_set:
            current_num = num
            current_length = 1

            # Count the length of the sequence
            while current_num + 1 in num_set:
                current_num += 1
                current_length += 1

            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)

    return max_length
```

In this code:
- We first check for an edge case where `nums` is empty, in which case we return 0 as there can't be any sequence.
- We then convert the list `nums` to a `set` for efficient look-ups.
- Then, we iterate through each number in this set, using it as the potential start of a new sequence.
- The inner `while` loop keeps incrementing `current_length` while the consecutive sequence continues. This only happens if the current number being checked is indeed the start of a new sequence (hence the `if num - 1 not in num_set` check).
- `max_length` is updated with the maximum value between the current `max_length` and the `current_length` obtained for the current sequence.
- Finally, we return `max_length` as the result.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(n). Although there are two nested loops, the inner loop runs at most n times in total, because it only runs for consecutive starting points. Each number is part of exactly one sequence.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n). We use a set to store the elements of `nums`.

### Real-World Applications
This problem can represent real-world scenarios where you need to find continuous ranges or sequences from a dataset. This can apply to date ranges, event logs, or any scenario where contiguous data is relevant.

### Common Pitfalls and Tips
- Avoid the mistake of trying to sort the array which would result in a higher time complexity.
- Be mindful about the edge case where the input array is empty.

### Similar Problems and Pattern Recognition
This problem is an instance of sequence computation and hash table utilization. Similar problems might involve finding the length of a subarray satisfying certain conditions or identifying unbroken sequences of numbers or events.

While these problems have different constraints and requirements, they involve similar strategies concerning the use of hashsets/hashmaps and requiring efficient solutions that avoid unnecessary sorting or nested iterations. Understanding the use of sets and maps is crucial for solving such problems efficiently.
