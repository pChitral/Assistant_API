LeetCode Problem 30 is titled "Substring with Concatenation of All Words".

### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words` of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in `s` that is a concatenation of each word in `words` exactly once, and without any intervening characters.

### Input
- s: A string where 0 <= `s.length` <= 10,000
- words: An array of strings where 1 <= `words.length` <= 5000 and 1 <= `words[i].length` <= 30

### Output
Return all starting indices in `s` where such concatenation substrings start. The indices must be in sorted order.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
The challenge here is to identify all substrings in `s` which are exactly made up by concatenating all the words from the `words` array, with each word used exactly once. This implies that:
- The order of words in the concatenation can be any.
- The concatenated substring must have a length equal to the total length of all words combined.
- Substrings must consist of the words in their entirety, with no partial words or additional characters.

Key points to consider are:
- Two or more words in the array `words` could be identical.
- Not all words need to appear in `s`.
- The starting indices should be in ascending order.
- Overlapping substrings that fit the criteria should each be listed.
- Since the words can be in any order, all permutations need to be taken into account, which adds complexity to the problem.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
A brute-force approach to this problem would involve generating all possible concatenations of the `words` array and then checking if each exists in `s`, recording the starting index where found. However, this would be extremely inefficient, given the potential number of permutations to check and the cost of the contains operation if done naïvely.

A more efficient approach relies on sliding window and hashing techniques:
1. Calculate the total length of all words combined, which will be the length of the required window in `s`.
2. Use a hashmap (Python dictionary) to count the occurrences of each word in `words`.
3. Slide a window of the calculated length across `s` and at each step:
   a. Divide the window into substrings of the word's length.
   b. Use another hashmap to count the occurrences of these substrings within the window.
   c. If the count matches the original hashmap for each word, record the starting index of the window.

The final algorithm would ensure that only relevant parts of `s` are checked and would avoid unnecessary computation that would come with the brute-force method.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
Let's implement the more efficient approach in Python:

```python
def findSubstring(s, words):
    if not s or not words:
        return []

    word_length = len(words[0])
    word_count = len(words)
    word_map = {}
    result = []

    # Build the word count hashmap
    for word in words:
        if word in word_map:
            word_map[word] += 1
        else:
            word_map[word] = 1

    # The total length of the window in s
    window_length = word_length * word_count

    # Start sliding the window
    for i in range(word_length):
        left = i
        temp_map = {}
        count = 0
        
        # Scan the string in steps of word length
        for j in range(i, len(s) - word_length + 1, word_length):
            word = s[j:j+word_length]
            # If the word is part of words
            if word in word_map:
                if word in temp_map:
                    temp_map[word] += 1
                else:
                    temp_map[word] = 1

                count += 1
                # If a word count exceeds its expected frequency, shift the window
                while temp_map[word] > word_map[word]:
                    temp_map[s[left:left+word_length]] -= 1
                    left += word_length
                    count -= 1

                # If count matches the word count, we found a solution
                if count == word_count:
                    result.append(left)
                    
                    # Shrink the window by one word to continue searching
                    temp_map[s[left:left+word_length]] -= 1
                    left += word_length
                    count -= 1
            else:
                temp_map.clear()
                count = 0
                left = j + word_length

    return result
```

Let's break this code down:
- We check if `s` or `words` are empty. If either is, there can be no valid substring, and we return an empty list.
- `word_length` and `word_count` store the length of each word and the number of words, respectively.
- `word_map` is our frequency map for the words in `words`.
- We calculate `window_length`, which is the length of the substring in `s` we are looking for.
- The outer loop starts from the beginning of `s` and iterates over it by the length of a single word to check for the concatenated substrings.
- `left` will mark the start of our sliding window, and `temp_map` will store the frequency of the words within the current window.
- The inner loop iterates from the current position `i` to the end of `s`, in steps of `word_length`.
- If a new valid word is found in `s` that is in `words`, we update `temp_map`.
- If a word's frequency gets exceeded, we move the `left` pointer to the right, effectively shrinking the window and updating the count.
- When `count` equals `word_count`, it means we have found a valid concatenation starting at `left`, which we add to `result`.

### Elaborate Examples
Let's consider an example:
```python
s = "barfoothefoobarman"
words = ["foo","bar"]
# Expected output: [0, 9]
```

With `word_length = 3` and `window_length = 6`, we would slide our window across `s` and find matches starting at index `0` and index `9`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n * m * k), where `n` is the length of the string `s`, `m` is the number of words in `words`, and `k` is the length of each word. In the worst case, we are checking each sub-window of length m * k within the string `s`.
- Space Complexity: O(m), for the hashmap `word_map` that contains at most `m` elements from `words`, where `m` is the number of words. Additional space for `temp_map` is also needed, but it does not grow larger than `word_map`.

### Real-World Applications
The problem could resemble real-world situations where pattern recognition or searching for a specific sequence of items within a larger dataset is required, such as:
- Detecting plagiarism by searching for specific sequences of words within a text.
- Forensic analysis for finding digital footprints in datasets.
- Bioinformatics, particularly searching for patterns in DNA sequences where the “words” could be specific sequences of nucleotides.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks
Common pitfalls include not correctly handling duplicate words in `words` and not correctly adjusting the sliding window when a word frequency is exceeded. A useful trick is to process the string `s` in chunks of the word length to improve efficiency.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem is an instance of a sliding window combined with a hashmap for frequency counting. This pattern is often suitable for problems that require finding substrings or contiguous segments within a larger string or array that meet certain criteria.
