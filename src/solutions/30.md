LeetCode Problem 30 is referred to as "Substring with Concatenation of All Words". This is a hard-level problem that demands a thorough understanding of string manipulation, hashing, and sliding window techniques in algorithms. Let's break down the problem in detail.

## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words` of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in `s` that is a concatenation of each word in `words` exactly once and without any intervening characters.

**Input:** 
The input consists of a string `s` and an array of strings `words`.

**Output:** 
The output should be a list of starting indices of the substring(s) in `s` that fulfill the criteria mentioned in the problem statement.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
- All the strings consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, you need to perform the following steps:

1. **Hashing each word in `words`:**
   Create a hash table (like a dictionary in Python) to store the count of each word in the `words` list. This hash table would help to quickly check if a word is part of `words`.

2. **Traversing the string `s`:**
   Traverse `s` with a sliding window that would attempt to match the concatenation of words from `words`. The window size must be equal to the sum of all the lengths of the words in `words`.

3. **Matching the words in the sliding window:**
   Within each window, divide the window into segments equal to the length of the words in `words`. For each segment, check if the segment exists in the hash table, and decrease its count, noting that counts shouldn't fall below zero (which would imply more occurrences than needed). If all words match correctly, record the starting index of the window.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   Ensure that you should cover edge cases where `s` is shorter than the sum of the lengths of `words`, or where `words` is empty.

5. **Resetting Window Counts:**
   After traversing a window, if the entire concatenation isn't found, reset the relevant counts in the hash table and slide the window forward.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation

Upon coding this solution, the explanation will be provided line by line.

## Elaborate Examples

For instance, if `s` is `"barfoothefoobarman"` and `words` is `["foo","bar"]`, then `s[0:6]` ("barfoo") and `s[9:15]` ("foobar") are the substrings starting at indices `0` and `9` that contain a concatenation of "foo" and "bar".

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * m * len)` where `n` is the length of the string `s`, `m` is the number of words, and `len` is the average length of a word in `words`. This is because we are traversing the string and within each traversal, iterating over the words.
  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m)` where `m` is the number of words as we create a hash map to maintain the count of words.

## Real-World Applications

This problem can be correlated to situations where we need to match patterns in a given text, such as detecting plagiarism, search engines matching queries with documents, or DNA sequence alignment in bioinformatics.

## Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- **Pitfall**: Not accounting for overlapping words when sliding the window.
- **Trick**: Using a double hash table (current count and expected count) to avoid recomputation.

## Problem Pattern Identification

This problem is a classic example of the "Sliding Window" pattern, often used when you have an array/string and you're looking for some subrange in the array/string, such as a substring with some property or the smallest subarray covering all the elements of a set.
