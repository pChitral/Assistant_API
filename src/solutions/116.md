The LeetCode problem with the number 116 is titled "Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node". Here is a detailed breakdown of the problem and how to approach a solution in Python.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

This problem is part of the tree data structure category and specifically deals with a perfect binary tree. A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.

The goal of the problem is to connect each node to its next right node at the same level. For the last node in each level, since there is no node to the right of it, its `next` pointer should be set to `nullptr` (or in Python, `None`). This should be done in a way that each node's next pointer is set to the right node on the same level of the binary tree.

A new data structure is defined for the tree node, which includes a next pointer along with the usual val, left, and right pointers:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.next = next
```

The binary tree is initially not connected, i.e., all `next` pointers are `None`.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, we can consider several approaches. However, one of the most intuitive methods is to perform a level-order traversal (also known as breadth-first search) since we need to connect nodes on the same level. During the level-order traversal, we can connect the next pointers of the nodes at the current level before moving on to the next level.

However, given the nature of the problem and the perfect binary tree condition, we can also devise a more space-efficient approach that utilizes the fact that we are dealing with a perfect binary tree, which would allow using the next pointers themselves for traversal instead of an auxiliary data structure like a queue.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Here is an example of an efficient solution that leverages the perfect binary tree structure:

```python
def connect(root):
    if not root:
        return None
    
    leftmost = root  # Start with the root node
    while leftmost.left:  # The loop runs until we reach the last level
        head = leftmost  # Head of the current level
        while head:  # Iterate over all nodes in the current level
            head.left.next = head.right  # Connect the left child to the right child
            
            # If there is a next right node, connect the right child to the left child
            # of the next node
            if head.next:
                head.right.next = head.next.left
            
            # Move to the next node on the current level
            head = head.next
        
        # Move to the next level
        leftmost = leftmost.left
    
    return root
```

Here's what each part of the code does:

- We start by checking if the root is `None`. If it is, there's nothing to connect, so we return `None`.

- We initialize a variable `leftmost` to keep track of the leftmost node at the current level. Initially, this is the root.

- The outer `while` loop runs as long as there are more levels to process, which is indicated by `leftmost.left`.

- Inside the loop, we use the `head` variable to traverse the current level. This variable starts at the leftmost node and moves rightward.

- For each node at the current level, we perform two connections:
    - We connect the `left` child to the `right` child of the current node (`head`).
    - If there is a next node (`head.next`), we connect the `right` child of the current node to the `left` child of the next node.

- After connecting the children of the current node, we move the `head` to the `next` node on the same level.

- When we've finished connecting all nodes at the current level, we move to the next level by setting `leftmost` to its left child.

- At the end of the process, we return the `root` of the tree. Now the `next` pointers are appropriately set.

### Elaborate Examples:

Imagine a perfect binary tree like this:

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \ / \
    4  5 6  7
```

After running the function `connect`, the tree should have the `next` pointers connected as follows (denoted by arrows):

```
        1 -> None
       / \
      2 -> 3 -> None
     / \ / \
    4->5->6->7 -> None
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: The time complexity for this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once to set its `next` pointer.

- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) as we do not use any additional data structure for level traversal. Since we are leveraging the next pointers themselves to navigate through the levels, no extra space is required besides the input data structure. We are only using a fixed number of pointers to keep track of nodes at the current level.

### Real-World Applications:

This problem can be seen as an abstraction of tasks that involve linking similar entities that are on the same hierarchy or level. For example, in networking, arranging devices in a ring topology where each device is connected to its next device on the same network level, or in process scheduling, connecting processes at the same priority level for efficient scheduling.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

One common pitfall is neglecting the perfect binary tree condition of the problem. This assumption allows us to avoid using additional data structures and complete the problem with constant space complexity.

The main trick lies in utilizing the `next` pointers to traverse the tree level by level, which is a unique characteristic of the problem and not a common technique in tree traversal.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem can be identified as a tree traversal problem with an application of the level-order traversal pattern. Recognizing this pattern is essential because many other tree problems use similar traversal techniques.
