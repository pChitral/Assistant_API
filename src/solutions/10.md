Problem number 10 on LeetCode is "Regular Expression Matching". Here's an extensive breakdown of the problem, the solution, and everything related to it:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The problem presents two strings where the first is a text string `s` and the second is a pattern `p`, and our task is to implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'`. The `'.'` character matches any single character, while `'*'` means zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial). The function signature given is:

```python
def isMatch(s: str, p: str) -> bool:
```

The nuances of this problem lie in the interpretation of the `'*'` character in the context of the preceding character and in handling cases where multiple `'*'` characters are in sequence or where `'*'` follows a `'.'`.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
The regular expression matching problem is typically solved using Dynamic Programming (DP). The idea is to create a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents whether `s[0..i-1]` matches `p[0..j-1]`.

Here are the conditions:
- If `p[j-1]` is a single character, `dp[i][j]` depends on whether `s[i-1]` is the same as `p[j-1]` or `p[j-1]` is `'.'`.
- If `p[j-1]` is `'*'`, we have two sub-cases:
  1. We can "ignore" the character and the star (`dp[i][j-2]`).
  2. If the character before `'*'` is a match, we can "consume" one instance of that character from the string `s` and compare `dp[i-1][j]`.

The base case for the DP initialization is that an empty string matches an empty pattern (`dp[0][0] = True`), and we need to fill in the rest of the DP table based on the abovementioned rules.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
I will provide a sample Python code and explain the functionality:

```python
def isMatch(s, p):
    m, n = len(s), len(p)
    dp = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = True

    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if p[i - 1] == '*':
            dp[0][i] = dp[0][i - 2]

    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if p[j - 1] == '*':
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 2] or (dp[i - 1][j] and (s[i - 1] == p[j - 2] or p[j - 2] == '.'))
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] and (s[i - 1] == p[j - 1] or p[j - 1] == '.')

    return dp[m][n]
```

- `dp` is a 2D list of boolean values, initially set to False.
- `dp[0][0] = True` because an empty string matches an empty pattern.
- We preprocess the DP table `dp[0][j]` to cover patterns that are made up only of `'*'` characters and their preceding characters.
- The outer loop runs through the text `s`, and the inner loop runs through the pattern `p`.
- Inside the nested loop, we fill `dp` according to whether the current character in pattern `p` is `'*'` or not.

### Elaborate Examples:
Let's consider a few examples:
1. `s = "aab"` and `p = "c*a*b"`. There are three parts to the pattern; `c*` can match zero occurrences of 'c', `a*` can match two occurrences of 'a', and `b` matches 'b'. So the result is `True`.
2. `s = "mississippi"` and `p = "mis*is*p*."`. Despite the presence of stars, the final 'p' in the pattern cannot be matched because the string has an additional 'i' after 'p', resulting in `False`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(m * n), where m is the length of the string `s` and n is the length of the pattern `p`, because we need to fill in an m by n DP table.

The space complexity is also O(m * n) for the same reason.

### Real-World Applications:
Regular expression matching is widely used in parsing text, data validation, syntax highlighting, and many other areas that involve pattern matching and text processing.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- Edge cases where the pattern is empty but the string is not, or vice versa, are tricky and could lead to incorrect solutions if not handled properly.
- Patterns ending with `'*'` might match zero or more of any characters, so always consider both possibilities.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
Recognizing that this is a dynamic programming problem is crucial. This pattern involves breaking down the problem into subproblems, solving those subproblems, and then combining them to form a solution to the original problem.
