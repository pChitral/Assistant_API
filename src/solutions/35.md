LeetCode Problem 35 is titled "Search Insert Position." Let's break down the problem:

### Problem Statement:
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

The problem specifies some conditions:
- The array consists of distinct integers.
- The array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Function Signature:
```python
def searchInsert(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
```

### Input:
- `nums`: An array of integers sorted in ascending order (non-decreasing).
- `target`: An integer target value to search for or to find the insert position of.

### Output:
- An integer, which is the index of the target if it exists in the array, or the index where the target should be inserted.

### Examples:
```python
# Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2

# Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1

# Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4

# Example 4:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 0
Output: 0
```

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
The problem is an application of the binary search algorithm, as the input array is sorted. A binary search is preferable over linear search as it has a time complexity of O(log n) compared to O(n) for a linear search, where n is the number of elements in the array.

Here’s how a binary search would typically be implemented for this problem:
1. Define two pointers, `left` and `right`, where `left` is initialized to 0, and `right` is initialized to `len(nums) - 1`.
2. Perform a while loop where `left` <= `right`.
3. Compute the middle index `mid = (left + right) // 2`.
4. If `nums[mid]` equals the `target`, return `mid`.
5. If `nums[mid]` is less than the `target`, shift the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`; otherwise, shift the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`.
6. If the loop ends, the `target` is not found, and `left` will be the position where the target should be inserted. Return `left`.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
```python
def searchInsert(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return left
```

- `left` and `right` pointers define the bounds of the search space within the array.
- `mid` is determined by the average of `left` and `right`, which identifies the center element of the current search space.
- We compare the `target` with the middle element `nums[mid]`.
- Based on the comparison, we either return the middle index, or we narrow the search space.
- If `target` is not found, `left` would be the correct insert position, as it would be the smallest index greater than the `target`.

### Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(log n), as the search space is halved in each step.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as the algorithm uses constant extra space.

### Elaborate Examples:
Consider the following scenario:
```python
Input: nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], target = 7
```
Here's how the binary search progresses:
- Initial state: left = 0, right = 4, mid = 2
- nums[mid] = 6, target = 7 -> left = mid + 1 = 3
- new state: left = 3, right = 4, mid = 3
- nums[mid] = 8, target = 7 -> right = mid - 1 = 2
- Since left > right, loop ends.

The correct insertion position is at index 3.

### Real-World Applications:
This algorithm is not only used for search operations but is also fundamental for problems that require insertion into sorted data without the overhead of re-sorting the entire structure.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- Mismanaging the `left` and `right` pointers can lead to infinite loops or incorrect results.
- Always ensure that `left` is updated to `mid + 1` and `right` to `mid - 1`, not `mid` itself, to prevent infinite loops.
- When returning `left` at the end, it should not be incremented again — it already points to the correct insertion position.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem follows a classic binary search pattern and is a good example of slightly adjusting the binary search to not just find an element but also to find a suitable insertion position.
