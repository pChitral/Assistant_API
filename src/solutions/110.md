LeetCode problem number 110 is "Balanced Binary Tree." In this problem, you're given a binary tree and you must determine if the tree is height-balanced. A binary tree is considered height-balanced if, for every node, the heights of the left and right subtrees never differ by more than one.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
In more detail, the problem states:
- You are given the root of a binary tree.
- You need to ensure that for every node in the tree, the depth of the left subtree and the depth of the right subtree differ by no more than 1.
- If the tree satisfies this condition, the function should return `True`. If the tree does not satisfy this condition at any node, the function should return `False`.

A binary tree node is typically defined as:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
To solve this problem, you can use a recursive approach that works its way up from the leaf nodes to the root:

1. The base case of the recursion is when you reach a `None` leaf node. Here, the height is 0.
2. For each node, you recursively compute the height of its left and right subtrees.
3. If the difference in heights is more than 1, you can immediately conclude that the tree is not balanced. You could throw an exception or use a global variable to record that the tree is unbalanced.
4. If the tree is balanced up to the current node, return the height of the current node, which is `1 + max(height of left subtree, height of right subtree)`.
5. When the recursion unwinds, it will ultimately return whether the tree is balanced and what the height of the tree is (though the height is relevant only if the tree is balanced).

A common optimization is to short-circuit the recursion if you find that the tree is not balanced so that you do not continue to compute heights for other branches of the tree unnecessarily.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Here's one way the solution could look in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        def checkBalanced(node):
            if not node:
                return 0
            leftHeight = checkBalanced(node.left)
            if leftHeight == -1: return -1  # Short-circuiting if left subtree is unbalanced
            rightHeight = checkBalanced(node.right)
            if rightHeight == -1: return -1  # Short-circuiting if right subtree is unbalanced
            
            if abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1:
                return -1  # Returning -1 if the current node is unbalanced
            return max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1
        
        return checkBalanced(root) != -1
```

In this code:
- The nested `checkBalanced` function is a recursive helper function that returns the height of the subtree rooted at the given node if it is balanced; otherwise, it returns `-1` to indicate that the tree is not balanced.
- The check for unbalance is done via the `abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1` condition. If this condition is true, `-1` is returned up the call stack.
- By returning `-1` when a subtree is unbalanced, we ensure that further recursion is avoided (`leftHeight == -1` and `rightHeight == -1` checks), effectively "short-circuiting" the unnecessary computation.
- The outer function `isBalanced` simply starts the recursive check at the root and returns `True` if the result is not `-1`.

### Elaborate Examples:
Consider the following binary tree:

```
      1
     / \
    2   2
   / \   
  3   3  
 /     
4
```

The subtree rooted at the node with value `3` on the left-hand side has a height of 2, while the subtree rooted at the node with value `3` on the right-hand side has a height of 0. This difference is greater than 1, so the tree is not balanced and the function would return `False`.

### Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: \( O(N) \), where \( N \) is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited once.
- Space Complexity: \( O(H) \), where \( H \) is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (a completely unbalanced tree), \( H = N \), which would also make the space complexity \( O(N) \).

### Real-World Applications:
Balanced binary trees are crucial in many real-world scenarios where data needs to be fetched rapidly, like in databases and file systems. Knowing whether a tree is balanced can influence algorithm decisions to maintain optimal search, insert, and delete operations.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
One common mistake is to recompute heights repeatedly for the same nodes during the recursion. Another is not implementing a method for early termination when an imbalance is detected, resulting in unnecessary computation.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem fits into the "Tree Traversal" and "Divide and Conquer" patterns. Recognizing that you need to compare the height of subtrees and that you can solve the problem recursively from the bottom up is key to solving similar problems.
