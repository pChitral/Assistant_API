LeetCode problem number 31 is titled "Next Permutation," and here's a detailed breakdown of the problem, followed by an in-depth explanation of the solution methods in Python.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The "Next Permutation" problem asks us to implement a function that modifies an array of integers by finding the next lexicographically greater permutation of the array's numbers. If such a permutation does not exist (the arrangement is the highest possible permutation), we should rearrange the array into its lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

A permutation of an array of numbers is an arrangement of its members into a new sequence or ordering. Lexicographical order is the generalization of the alphabetical order of the dictionaries to sequences of ordered elements or numbers.

Here are some examples to illustrate the concept:
- The next permutation of [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
- The next permutation of [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] is the highest possible permutation.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify the longest non-increasing suffix (i.e., a part of the array where elements from the end are in descending order). This suffix cannot generate a larger permutation by swapping any of its elements.
2. Look at the element just before the identified suffix (let's call it the pivot).
3. If the pivot does not exist (the entire array is non-increasing), simply reverse the whole array.
4. If the pivot exists, find the rightmost element in the suffix that is greater than the pivot (it will be the element just larger than the pivot).
5. Swap the pivot with that element.
6. Reverse the suffix to get the lowest possible order for the new prefix.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Let's write the Python code based on the rationale given above and explain it line by line:

```python
def nextPermutation(nums):
    if not nums or len(nums) <= 1:
        return  # No need to do anything for an empty array or array with only one element

    # Step 1: Identify the longest non-increasing suffix
    i = len(nums) - 1
    while i > 0 and nums[i - 1] >= nums[i]:
        i -= 1

    # If such a suffix does not exist, reverse the entire array (Step 3)
    if i == 0:
        nums.reverse()
        return

    # Step 2: Identify the pivot
    # The pivot is the element just before the suffix
    pivot = i - 1

    # Step 4: Find the rightmost element greater than the pivot
    j = len(nums) - 1
    while j > pivot and nums[j] <= nums[pivot]:
        j -= 1

    # Step 5: Swap the pivot with this element
    nums[pivot], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[pivot]

    # Step 6: Reverse the suffix
    nums[i:] = reversed(nums[i:])

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 3]
nextPermutation(nums)
print(nums)  # Should print [1, 3, 2]
```

- We start by handling the edge cases where the array has zero or one element. In these cases, there's nothing to do.
- Then we find the longest non-increasing suffix by iterating backward from the end with a `while` loop.
- If we reach the start of the array while looking for the suffix (i.e., the entire array is non-increasing), we reverse it to transform it into the lowest permutation and exit the function early.
- We identify the pivot, which is the last increase in the array when observed from the end.
- We find the smallest number in the suffix greater than the pivot by iterating backward until the condition `nums[j] <= nums[pivot]` is false.
- We swap this rightmost larger element with the pivot.
- Finally, we reverse the suffix to make sure that after the pivot, the sequence is in the lowest possible order, completing the transformation to the next permutation.

### Elaborate Examples:
1. Given `nums = [1, 2, 3]`, pivot is `2`, swap with `3`, and the result is `[1, 3, 2]`.
2. Given `nums = [3, 2, 1]`, pivot does not exist; reverse the entire array to get `[1, 2, 3]`.
3. Given `nums = [1, 1, 5]`, pivot is `1` at index 1, swap with `5`, and after reversing the suffix `[1]`, the result is `[1, 5, 1]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(n) since we're scanning the list a few times but only in linear passes. The space complexity is O(1) because we modify the array in place without using extra space for another data structure.
