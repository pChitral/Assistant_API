LeetCode Problem 31 is "Next Permutation," which is categorized under the array and two pointers topics. This problem requires a good understanding of permutations and algorithms to efficiently find the next lexicographically greater permutation of numbers.

Here's an extensive breakdown of the problem:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

Given an array of integers representing a permutation, the goal is to rearrange the numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

If such an arrangement is not possible (i.e., the array is sorted in descending order), the function should rearrange the numbers into the lowest possible order (ascending order). The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

To better understand the problem, let's take "permutation" and "lexicographic order" into consideration:

- A **permutation** of an array is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.
- The **lexicographic or lexicographical order** is essentially the dictionary order. For example, in the dictionary, "apple" comes before "banana". Similarly, for arrays, [1, 2, 3] comes before [1, 3, 2].

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem efficiently, we use the following strategy:

1. Start from the end of the array and look backwards for the first pair of successive elements `(a[i], a[i+1])` where `a[i] < a[i+1]`. This step is crucial because the elements from `i+1` to the end of the array are in descending order and thus, there's no greater permutation possible within that sub-array. The number at `a[i]` is the number that needs to be swapped to make the permutation "bigger".

2. Then look backwards again from the end of the array to find the first element that is larger than `a[i]`. Let's call this number `a[j]`.

3. Swap `a[i]` and `a[j]`.

4. Reverse the sub-array that starts at `i+1` to the end of the array to get it in the lowest possible order (ascending order).

This strategy guarantees that we get the next permutation that is just greater than the current one.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's provide the Python code that implements the strategy and then break it down:

```python
def nextPermutation(nums):
    i = j = len(nums) - 1

    # Find first decreasing element
    while i > 0 and nums[i - 1] >= nums[i]:
        i -= 1
    if i == 0:   # nums are in descending order
        nums.reverse()
        return

    # Find successor to pivot
    k = i - 1    # pivot is at index i-1
    while nums[j] <= nums[k]:
        j -= 1
    nums[k], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[k]

    # Reverse suffix starting at i
    l, r = i, len(nums) - 1
    while l < r:
        nums[l], nums[r] = nums[r], nums[l]
        l, r = l + 1, r - 1

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3]
nextPermutation(nums)
print(nums)  # Output: [1, 3, 2]
```

Breaking down the code:
- `i` and `j` are initialized to point to the end of the list.
- The first `while` loop looks for the first decreasing element starting from the end of the `nums`.
- If such an element is not found, which means `i` reaches `0`, then the array is sorted in descending order, and we simply reverse it to get the smallest permutation.
- Next, we find the number just larger than the pivot (`nums[k]`), which is `nums[j]`. We then swap `nums[k]` and `nums[j]`.
- Finally, we reverse the sub-array starting from `i` to turn it into ascending order, which makes it the next smallest sequence of numbers after the original configuration.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's consider a example:
```
Array: 1 2 7 4 3 1
Step 1: Identify the longest non-increasing suffix
Suffix: 7 4 3 1 (wrong direction, it should be non-decreasing from right to left)
Pivot: 2

Step 2: Look for the number just larger than the pivot in the suffix
Number: 3

Step 3: Swap the pivot with the number found
Array after swap: 1 3 7 4 2 1

Step 4: Reverse the suffix
Final array: 1 3 1 2 4 7 (which is the next permutation)
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because each part of the algorithm (finding the first decreasing element, finding the element to swap with, and reversing the suffix) consists of at most one pass through the array.

The space complexity is O(1) since the solution is in place and only a constant amount of extra space is used, regardless of the input size.

### Real-World Applications

The concept of generating permutation sequences can be applied to real-world problems like generating password possibilities, arrangements of different items, scheduling, and in fields such as cryptography, game theory, and others where the ordering of elements is essential.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- One common pitfall is to attempt to generate all permutations and find the next one, which is not efficient.
- A subtle trick is to realize that the sequence is built from the end for optimal efficiency.
- Another common mistake is not realizing that the sequence should be reversed at the end if no "bigger" permutation is possible.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem follows the two-pointer strategy and manipulation of array elements to solve problems related to permutations or ordering without the need for brute force or extra memory.
