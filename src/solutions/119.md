LeetCode problem number 119 is titled "Pascal's Triangle II." The problem falls under the category of array and is generally considered to be an easy-level problem. However, understanding the nuances is crucial for an optimal solution.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The problem statement asks you to return the kth (0-indexed) row of Pascal's Triangle. Pascal’s Triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

Unlike the previous problem, where you were asked to generate the entire Pascal's triangle up to a certain number of rows, in this problem, you are only required to return the row corresponding to the provided index `k`. This constraint allows for more targeted, efficient solutions that use less memory since you only need to keep track of one row at a time.

Pascal's Triangle follows a simple rule: each element (except for the edges that are always 1) is obtained by adding the number above and to the left with the number above and to the right. For example, the first few rows of Pascal's Triangle are:

```
     1
    1 1
   1 2 1
  1 3 3 1
 1 4 6 4 1
```

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

There are multiple ways to approach this problem. A naïve approach would be to simply build Pascal's Triangle row by row until you reach the kth row. This is not the most optimal solution because you would be generating rows that you do not need.

A more efficient approach is to recognize that the kth row of Pascal's Triangle corresponds to the coefficients of the binomial expansion (a + b)^k. However, calculating the binomial coefficients can be computationally expensive, especially for larger values of k, so there are more optimized methods to generate the kth row directly.

An optimal solution uses the fact that each element can be generated using the previous element in the kth row:

```plaintext
row[i] = row[i-1] * (k - i + 1) / i
```

This equation comes from the properties of the binomial coefficients, where each term of a Pascal's Triangle row is equivalent to "k choose i".

#### Python Code Walkthrough

With the aforementioned insights, you can write a Python function that iteratively builds the kth row of Pascal's Triangle:

```python
def getRow(rowIndex):
    row = [1]
    for i in range(1, rowIndex + 1):
        row.append(row[i - 1] * (rowIndex - i + 1) // i)
    return row
```

Let's break down the code:
- `row` is initialized as `[1]`, the base case for the first row of Pascal's Triangle.
- The `for` loop goes from `1` to the `rowIndex` (inclusive) to build up the elements of the target row.
- Inside the loop, a new element is appended to `row`. This element is calculated from the previous element (`row[i - 1]`), multiplied by `(rowIndex - i + 1)` to get the upper part of the binomial coefficient, and divided by `i` (integer division `//`) to get the correct binomial coefficient without the need for factorial calculations.
- Finally, the function returns the complete `row`.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's consider an example by running the function with the input `3`, which should give us the third row of Pascal's Triangle (0-indexed).

```python
rowIndex = 3
print(getRow(rowIndex))
# Output should be [1, 3, 3, 1]
```

For `rowIndex = 3`, the function would perform the following steps:
1. Initialize `row` as `[1]`.
2. First loop iteration: `row.append(1 * (3 - 1 + 1) // 1)` which is `row.append(3)`; now `row` is `[1, 3]`.
3. Second loop iteration: `row.append(3 * (3 - 2 + 1) // 2)` which is `row.append(3)`; now `row` is `[1, 3, 3]`.
4. Third loop iteration: `row.append(3 * (3 - 3 + 1) // 3)` which is `row.append(1)`; now `row` is `[1, 3, 3, 1]`.
5. Return `[1, 3, 3, 1]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the given `rowIndex`. This is because the function calculates each element of the row in constant time and iterates once through the row length, which is the same as the rowIndex.

The space complexity is also O(n), as we need space to store the output row, with n being the rowIndex. No extra space is needed other than what's used to output the result, which makes this an in-place operation.

### Real-World Applications

Pascal's Triangle has various applications in mathematics, computer science, and other fields. For example:

- Combinatorics: The triangle is a representation of the binomial coefficients, which are useful in combinatorial mathematics for calculating combinations.
- Probability: In probability theory, binomial coefficients are used to determine the probabilities of certain outcomes, such as flipping coins or drawing cards.
- Algebra: The coefficients are applied in the expansion of binomial expressions.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

When implementing algorithms like this, there are a few things to watch out for:

1. Integer Overflow: While Python handles large integers well, in other languages or systems, calculating large binomial coefficients can lead to integer overflow. It's important to use appropriate data types or work with modulo arithmetic when needed.
2. Floating-Point Precision: Avoid using floating-point arithmetic to calculate the coefficients, as it can introduce rounding errors. Always use integer division when possible.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem exemplifies a computational pattern where recognizing mathematical properties can optimize the solution. Instead of brute-force computation, using a smart mathematical observation reduces both time and space complexity.
