LeetCode problem number 12 is titled "Integer to Roman". This problem asks you to convert an integer to a Roman numeral.

## Problem Statement

Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral. Roman numerals are represented by combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet (I, V, X, L, C, D, M). Here are the basic rules:

- The numbers 1, 2, and 3 are represented by 'I', 'II', and 'III'.
- The number 4 is written as 'IV' (one before five).
- The number 5 is represented by 'V'.
- The number 9 is written as 'IX' (one before ten).
- The tens follow a similar pattern: 10 (X), 40 (XL), 50 (L), 90 (XC), 100 (C), 400 (CD), 500 (D), and 900 (CM).

Roman numerals consist of seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M.

Here are their values:

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not 'IIII'. Instead, the number four is written as 'IV'. Because the one is before the five, we subtract it making four. This rule applies when the base symbol (I, X, C) is immediately followed by a symbol that represents a numeral that is equal to or larger than five times the base symbol's value.

For example:
3 is represented as "III", 58 is represented as "LVIII" (L = 50, V = 5, III = 3), and 1994 is represented as "MCMXCIV" (M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4).

### Constraints:
- 1 <= num <= 3999

## Solution Strategy

The key to solving this problem is to understand how Roman numerals are constructed. Since Roman numerals are formed by combining symbols according to their values with special rules for substractive notation (like IV instead of IIII), we can solve the problem by breaking down the integer into component parts that correspond to Roman numeral symbols.

An efficient way to do this is to have a mapping of the integer values that have direct Roman numeral equivalents. We can then iterate through this mapping in decreasing order of integer value, subtracting from the integer and appending the corresponding Roman numerals to our result until the integer is reduced to zero.

## Python Code Explanation

Here is a sample Python code that implements the above strategy:

```python
def intToRoman(num):
    # Map of integer to Roman numeral equivalents
    val_to_roman = [
        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), 
        (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),
        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), 
        (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),
        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), 
        (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), 
        (1, 'I')]
    
    # Resultant Roman numeral string
    roman = ""
    
    # Loop through the tuples in val_to_roman
    for i, r in val_to_roman:
        while num >= i:
            roman += r
            num -= i
    
    return roman
```

In this implementation:
- We iterate over the list of tuples `val_to_roman`, each containing a value and its Roman numeral representation.
- If the current number `num` is greater than or equal to `i`, the corresponding Roman numeral `r` is added to the `roman` string, and `i` is subtracted from `num`.
- The process is repeated until `num` is less than `i`.
- Once we have checked all possible values in `val_to_roman`, `roman` will contain the correct Roman numeral representation of the initial integer .

## Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(1) - The algorithm runs in constant time because the input number has a constraint from 1 to 3999, and there are a finite number of Roman numerals, so the maximum number of iterations is fixed and does not grow with the size of the input number.

Space Complexity: O(1) - The space used by the `val_to_roman` array is fixed, and the `roman` string will also contain a finite number of characters based on the input constraints.

## Real-World Application

The conversion of numbers to Roman numerals might not be very common in modern computing applications, but it is a good example that showcases the importance of understanding numeral systems and how they can be encoded into computer programs. It also serves as an exercise in string manipulation, which is a common task in many real-world applications such as data formatting, report generation, and user interfaces.

## Common Pitfalls and Tricks

One common pitfall is misunderstanding the Roman numeral system and how the subtractive notation works. Knowing that IV is used instead of IIII and IX is used instead of VIIII, for example, is crucial to getting the correct result. A good grasp of these rules is necessary not just for coding the solution but also for understanding why it works.

A helpful trick in this sort of problem is to start with the largest values and work your way down. This simplifies the logic and ensures that you're adding the largest possible Roman symbols first.

## Problem Pattern Identification

This problem is a form of "mapping" where you are transforming one system of representing numbers into another. This pattern is found in various other problems where you need to convert between different units or encodings. Recognizing the mapping pattern can help you quickly identify the need for a conversion table or similar structure to aid in the transformation.
