The LeetCode problem with the number 120 is the "Triangle" problem. Here's a comprehensive analysis of the problem:

### Problem Statement:

Given a `triangle` array, we need to find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step, we may move to the adjacent numbers on the row below. The triangle array is a list of lists of integers where `triangle[i]` contains `i+1` elements.

The problem can be visualized as an actual triangle, where each level corresponds to an element of the triangle array, and the values are the actual numbers in the triangle.

```
For example, a triangle array might look like this:

   [2],
  [3,4],
 [6,5,7],
[4,1,8,3]

Which represents the triangle:

     2
    3 4
   6 5 7
  4 1 8 3
```

The goal is to start from the top and reach the bottom with the smallest possible sum of numbers, where each step is either directly down or diagonally to the right.

### Solution Strategy:

There are several approaches one could take to solve this problem:

1. Recursive Solution (Top-Down Approach): We can recursively calculate the minimum path sum starting from the top element of the triangle, going down to each of the two adjacent numbers, and keeping track of the minimum at each step. However, this approach has exponential time complexity due to a large number of redundant calculations.

2. Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up Approach): A more efficient way is to use dynamic programming to build up the solution from the bottom of the triangle. We can iterate from the second-last row to the top row and calculate the minimum path sum by adding the current element with the minimum of its two adjacent elements on the row below. This approach is both time and space-efficient.

3. In-Place Dynamic Programming: This is a variation of the Bottom-Up approach. Instead of using an auxiliary space to keep track of intermediate results, we can modify the given triangle array in place, which saves space.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's focus on the in-place dynamic programming approach, which is usually preferred due to its efficiency:

```python
def minimumTotal(triangle):
    # Start from the second last row and move upward
    for row in range(len(triangle) - 2, -1, -1):
        # For each cell in the current row
        for col in range(len(triangle[row])):
            # Update the current cell with the sum of its value and 
            # the minimum of the two adjacent cells in the row below
            triangle[row][col] += min(triangle[row + 1][col], triangle[row + 1][col + 1])
    
    # The result is now at the top of the triangle
    return triangle[0][0]
```

In this code:
- We start looping from the second-last row to the top (`for row in range(len(triangle) - 2, -1, -1)`).
- We access each element of the current row (`for col in range(len(triangle[row]))`).
- We update each element by adding itself to the minimum of its two adjacent numbers from the row below (`triangle[row][col] += min(...)`).
- Once the loop is finished, the top element of the triangle (`triangle[0][0]`) contains the minimum path sum.

### Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: Since every element of the triangle is looked at exactly once, the time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the number of rows in the triangle.
- Space Complexity: We do not use any extra space except for a few variables for iteration. Thus, the space complexity is O(1) since it updates the original triangle in place.

### Practical Applications:

This kind of problem is abstract but could be likened to decision-making pathways where the goal is to reach a decision or endpoint with the lowest cost associated, potentially applicable to optimizations in routing, resource allocation, etc.

### Common Pitfalls and Tips:

- The main pitfall is to attempt a recursive solution without memoization, which would lead to a much higher runtime due to redundant calculations.
- Ensure to understand the difference between the bottom-up and top-down approaches. Bottom-up typically leads to simpler and more efficient algorithms in dynamic programming scenarios.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem is an example of dynamic programming, a common pattern where optimal solutions to subproblems are reused to build up solutions to larger problems.
