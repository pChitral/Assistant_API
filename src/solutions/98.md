The LeetCode problem number 98 is titled "Validate Binary Search Tree (BST)". The problem statement is as follows:

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
  
### Extensive Problem Breakdown
When approaching this problem, we need to thoroughly understand the properties of a binary search tree:
1. Every node's left subtree contains values strictly less than the node's value.
2. Every node's right subtree contains values strictly greater than the node's value.
3. Both the left and right subtree each must also be a valid binary search tree.

This recursive definition of a BST is central to validating whether a given binary tree meets the criteria. The problem can be tricky because it is not enough to check these conditions only for the immediate children of any node. Each subtree must be checked thoroughly, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied throughout the tree.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
There are a few methods to determine if a binary tree is a valid BST which we can consider:

1. **In-Order Traversal:** By performing an in-order traversal (left-root-right) on a BST, we should obtain a list of values in ascending order. If at any point this order is violated, we can conclude that the tree is not a valid BST.

2. **Recursive Traversal with Range Checking:** This involves recursively checking each subtree. For each node, check if the node's value falls within a valid range (initially negative infinity to positive infinity). When traversing left, the upper bound becomes the current node's value, and when traversing right, the lower bound becomes the current node's value.

3. **Iterative Traversal:** An iterative approach using a stack that simulates the in-order traversal can also be used to validate a BST.

The recursive method with range checking is often preferred because it is efficient and quite intuitive once understood. It checks every node only once and uses the BST properties effectively.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
Here's an example of how a recursive solution could be implemented in Python:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def isValidBST(root, left=float('-inf'), right=float('inf')):
    if not root:
        return True
    if not (left < root.val < right):
        return False
    # Recursively validate the left and right subtree
    return (isValidBST(root.left, left, root.val) and
            isValidBST(root.right, root.val, right))

# Usage
root = TreeNode(2, TreeNode(1), TreeNode(3))
print(isValidBST(root))  # True
```

In this code:

- The `isValidBST` function checks whether the tree rooted at `root` is a valid BST within the range defined by `left` and `right`.
- Initially, the allowed range is from negative to positive infinity.
- For each node, compare its value to the allowed range. If the node's value does not fall within this range, return `False`.
- Recursively call `isValidBST` on the left subtree, updating the upper bound to the current node's value.
- Recursively call `isValidBST` on the right subtree, updating the lower bound to the current node's value.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's consider the following example:

Given a binary tree like this:

```
    2
   / \
  1   3
```
- The call to `isValidBST` with root node 2 will check if `1 < 2 < inf`. This is true, so it will proceed to check the subtrees.
- The recursive call to `isValidBST` with root node 1 will check if `-inf < 1 < 2`. This is true, and since node 1 has no children, the left subtree is valid.
- The recursive call to `isValidBST` with root node 3 will check if `2 < 3 < inf`. This is true, and since node 3 has no children, the right subtree is valid.
- The tree is determined to be a valid BST.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the function `isValidBST` is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node in the tree is visited exactly once during the traversal.

The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This reflects the maximum size of the call stack during the recursive calls. In the worst case (a degenerate tree), the space complexity can become O(N), while in the best case scenario (a balanced tree), the space complexity is O(log N).

### Real-World Applications

Validating binary search trees has practical relevance in various applications such as database indexing, where elements are stored in a BST to allow for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

Common pitfalls include not considering the entire subtree when validating a node. It's essential to compare every subtree rather than just a node's immediate children. This can trip people up if they forget the recursive nature of BSTs.

A useful trick is to consider range checking, setting a valid interval every time you move left or right, rather than just comparing with immediate children.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The problem of validating a BST is generally categorized under the tree traversal and recursion patterns. Recognizing such a pattern makes it easier to approach other tree-related problems.
