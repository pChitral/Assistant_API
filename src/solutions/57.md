LeetCode problem number 57 is titled "Insert Interval". This problem falls under the category of array and interval manipulation. The problem statement and requirements are as follows:

**Problem Statement**:
You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represent the start and the end of the i-th interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `start_i`. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Your task is to insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that the intervals are merged if necessary and still sorted in ascending order by start. The merged interval should be such that it covers all the numbers that were covered by `intervals` and `newInterval`.

The result should not have any overlap, and intervals in the result should be as minimal as they can possibly be, that is, no two intervals in the result should be able to merge into one interval.

**Examples**:
1. Given `intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]]` and `newInterval = [2,5]`, the result should be `[[1,5],[6,9]]`.
2. Given `intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]]` and `newInterval = [4,8]`, the result should be `[[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]`.

**Constraints**:
- `0 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= start_i <= end_i <= 10^5`
- `intervals` is sorted by `start_i` in strictly increasing order.
- `newInterval.length == 2`
- `0 <= start <= end <= 10^5`

**Solution Rationale**:
There are multiple ways to solve this problem, but a common approach is to iterate through each interval in `intervals` and consider three cases:

1. **If the current interval ends before the new interval starts**, simply add the current interval to the result list because there is no overlap.

2. **If the current interval starts after the new interval ends**, add `newInterval` to the result list since we know that no other intervals will overlap with it (as the list is sorted), and then add all remaining intervals to the result list.

3. **If the current interval overlaps with the new interval**, we need to merge them. This is done by updating the `newInterval` to have the minimum of the start points and the maximum of the end points of both the `newInterval` and the current interval.

After processing all intervals from the input, if the new interval has not been added to the result, it is added at the end since it doesn't overlap with any of the intervals in the result list.

**Python Code Explanation**:
In the Python code, we would loop through each interval in `intervals` while considering the cases above. The merging case requires us to update `newInterval`, while in the other two cases we add intervals to the result list. At the end, after we've processed all intervals, we need to check if `newInterval` has been added to result; if not, it should be appended.

**Complexity Analysis**:
- Time Complexity: Since we're iterating through the list of intervals only once, the time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of intervals in the input list.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is `O(n)` as well for the result list that we're constructing. In the worst-case scenario, none of the intervals will merge, so we'll have all original intervals and the new interval in our result list.

Let's code this up in Python to show how it can be implemented.
