LeetCode problem number 57 is titled "Insert Interval". This problem falls within the category of array manipulation, specifically dealing with intervals. Let me provide an extensive breakdown of the problem, including an in-depth solution rationale, code explanation, examples, complexity analysis, real-world applications, and links to similar problems.

## Problem Breakdown

Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, which are sorted by their start times, and a new interval, your task is to insert the new interval into the set of existing intervals. After the insertion, you have to make sure that the set still comprises non-overlapping intervals. If there are intervals that now overlap due to the insertion, these intervals must be merged.

Here are the fine details the problem statement includes:

- Intervals are represented as a list of lists of integers, where each list contains two numbers that denote the start and end of an interval.
- The intervals are initially sorted by their start times, which means you don't need to sort them before inserting.
- If an interval to be inserted causes overlaps, you need to merge all intervals that overlap with it into a single interval.
- The interval to be merged should have its start time as the smallest start time among all intervals that are being merged and the end time as the largest end time.
- The result should still be sorted by start times.
- The problem guarantees that the intervals' start and end times are all positive integers.

## In-Depth Solution Rationale

### Approach: One-pass

The one-pass algorithm works as follows:

1. Add all intervals starting before the new interval to the output.
2. Merge intervals that overlap with the new interval.
   - To merge, we compare the end of the new interval to the start of the current interval.
   - If they overlap (i.e., the start of the current interval is less than or equal to the end of the new interval), we merge them by updating the end of the new interval to the maximum of both ends.
3. Add the merged interval (the new interval itself, which might have been updated several times in step 2) to the output.
4. Finally, add all the remaining intervals to the output.

This approach leverages the fact that intervals are already sorted and ensures that each interval is processed only once.

### Python Code Explanation

In Python, this algorithm can be implemented using a list to store the output intervals and iterating over the input intervals to either add them to the output as is or to merge them with the new interval.

### Elaborate Examples

Here, we'll run through a few examples with different scenarios:

1. The new interval does not overlap with any existing interval and lies between two intervals.
2. The new interval overlaps with one or more existing intervals.
3. The new interval lies completely before or after all existing intervals.

### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of intervals. This is because we are going through each interval only once.

The space complexity is also O(N), to store the result which can, in the worst case, contain all the original intervals plus one new interval (when there is no overlap).

### Real-World Applications

Interval problems are common in real-world scenarios such as scheduling (finding free time slots), genomic ranges (locating gene overlaps), or managing reservations in systems like hotel bookings or seat allocations. Understanding how to manipulate intervals is essential in these domains.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

A common pitfall is not considering the case where the new interval overlaps with multiple existing intervals. You should ensure that merging continues until the new interval does not overlap with any other interval.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The problem is an example of interval merging and can be approached effectively by processing elements in a single pass whenever possible, taking advantage of sorted data.
