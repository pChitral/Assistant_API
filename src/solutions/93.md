LeetCode Problem 93 is titled "Restore IP Addresses." Let's break down this problem in detail.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem asks us to find all possible valid IP address combinations that can be formed by inserting three dots into a given string containing only digits. An IP address consists of four parts, each part can have one to three digits, so we are essentially breaking the string into four parts, separated by dots.

The rules for a string being a valid IP address are as follows:
1. Each part can contain between 1 and 3 digits.
2. Each part must not have leading zeros, except for the number 0 itself.
3. Each part must be less than or equal to 255.

A string is not allowed to be split into parts at any locations other than those that form a valid IP address, and if adding a dot would lead to an invalid part, then that dot placement is skipped.

#### Example:
Given the string `"25525511135"`, one possible and valid IP address combination is `"255.255.11.135"`.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, a backtracking algorithm is suitable. Backtracking is a common approach for generating all possible combinations or permutations of a dataset. 

Here is the strategy for backtracking in this problem:
1. Create a recursive function that takes the input string, and also the current list of segments (each segment represents one part of the IP address) and the position at which we are currently looking.
2. If we have four valid segments and we are at the end of the string, we have found a valid combination, and we should add it to our list of results.
3. If we are not at the end of the string, nor do we have four segments, we try to create a new segment by taking one, two, or three digits from the string and appending them to our current list of segments.
4. Each time we take digits from a string to form a segment, we check if the new segment is a valid IP segment (it has to be an integer between 0 and 255, and not have leading zeros except for the number 0 itself).
5. If the segment is valid, we proceed to the next position in the string by recursing with our updated current segments and position. If it isn't, we skip adding the digit and backtrack.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's write the Python code.

```python
def restoreIpAddresses(s):
    def valid(segment):
        # Check if a segment is valid:
        # 1. less than or equal to 255
        # 2. no leading zeros
        return int(segment) <= 255 if segment[0] != '0' else len(segment) == 1

    def backtrack(prev_pos=-1, dots=3):
        # Use nonlocal to modify variables from the outer scope
        nonlocal segments, output

        # Iterate over the positions that are allowed for the current dot
        # the current segment ends at position pos - 1
        for pos in range(prev_pos + 1, min(len(s), prev_pos + 4)):
            segment = s[prev_pos + 1:pos + 1]
            if valid(segment):
                segments.append(segment)  # place dot
                if dots - 1 == 0:  # if all 3 dots have been placed
                    update_output(pos)  # add the configuration to the output list
                else:
                    backtrack(pos, dots - 1)  # continue to place dots
                segments.pop()  # remove the last placed dot

    def update_output(curr_pos):
        nonlocal segments, output
        segment = s[curr_pos + 1:len(s)]
        if valid(segment):
            output.append('.'.join(segments + [segment]))

    output = []
    segments = []
    backtrack()
    return output
```

Let's walk through this code, snippet by snippet.

1. `valid(segment)`: This is a helper function that checks if a provided segment is a valid part of an IP address, meaning that it follows the rules set above.

2. `backtrack(prev_pos=-1, dots=3)`: This is the main backtracking function. It takes the previous position where we placed a dot (initially set to -1 since we haven't started), and the number of dots remaining to place (`dots`). 

3. The for loop within `backtrack()`: This loop iterate over all possible placements of the next dot. We make a recursive call to place the rest of the dots if the segment we cut is valid by our criteria. 

4. `update_output(curr_pos)`: This helper function is called when all dots have been placed (no more dots to place), and adds the complete valid IP address to the output list, if the last segment is also valid.

5. `output = []` and `segments = []`: These are the lists we use to keep track of the final IP addresses and the current segments we're considering along the way.

6. The last call to `backtrack()` actually starts our backtracking process.

7. Finally, we return the list of output, which contains all reconstructed IP address combinations.

### Elaborate Examples:

Consider the string `"25525511135"` again.

1. In the first recursive call, we take `"2"` as the first segment and recursively call backtrack with this segment.
2. Then `"55"` as the second segment, and so on.
3. As we continue doing this, one of the valid IP addresses we will find is `"255.255.11.135"`. Since all segments meet our validity criteria, this is added to the output list.

Another example could be a string like `"010010"`, which would return `["0.10.0.10", "0.100.1.0"]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

The backtracking algorithm will at most execute 3^(n-1) function calls, where n is the length of the input string S, because there are at most 3 different ways to continue with each step. However, this is the upper bound which doesn't take pruning into consideration.

In the best-case scenario, the complexity could be improved due to:
- Skipping the rest of the recursive calls when a valid IP address is found.
- Stopping the exploration of a branch when an invalid segment is generated, which happens often due to the nature of the constraints.

In the worst-case scenario, when we consider the recursion and the string manipulation (which adds its own complexity due to slicing), we could say that the time complexity is O(n * 3^n), and space complexity is O(n) (recursive call stack and segments list).

### Real-World Applications:

This algorithm could be used in network configuration software that needs to generate all possible IP addresses from some compact representation or when validating user input for IP addresses.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

Common pitfalls in this problem include not handling leading zeros correctly, and not checking the range of the numbers after conversion to integers (e.g., forgetting that IP address segments cannot be greater than 255).

A useful trick could be preprocessing the string to quickly discard cases that are obviously not valid, for example, if the string is less than 4 characters or more than 12, there is no need to proceed with the backtracking.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

The problem fits into the category of combinatorial search and/or backtracking problems. Recognizing this pattern is valuable for solving similar problems, which involve exploring a set of solutions that must satisfy certain constraints.
