The problem number 145 on LeetCode corresponds to "Binary Tree Postorder Traversal". This is a classic algorithmic challenge that involves traversing a binary tree. Here's an extensive problem breakdown, solution rationale, and other detailed insights for this problem.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

In binary tree postorder traversal, the goal is to visit all the nodes in a binary tree in a specific order: first, you visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the node itself. This order is commonly remembered by the acronym LRV (Left-Right-Visit), where "Visit" means reading or printing the value of the node.

The problem can be summarized as follows:

- You are given the root of a binary tree.
- You need to return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

This traversal method is essential in applications where operations on the parent node must happen after operations on the children, for example, when performing certain calculations, memory cleanup, or syntax tree analysis in compilers.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

There are several strategies to solve the postorder traversal problem:

1. **Recursive Approach**:
    - The recursive solution is a direct translation of the postorder traversal definition.
    - The recursion function calls itself to traverse the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally appends the current node's value to the result list.
    - This approach tends to be clean and concise.

2. **Iterative Approach**:
    - An iterative solution can be implemented using a stack to simulate the call stack that would be used in a recursive approach.
    - Traversal is done by looping until all nodes are visited while utilizing a stack to keep track of the nodes.
    - Care must be taken to visit nodes in the postorder sequence.
    - Iterative solutions are sometimes preferred due to stack overflow concerns with very deep trees when using recursion.

3. **Morris Traversal**:
    - This method allows for traversal without extra space (aside from the output list) and without modifying the tree structure.
    - It's a complex method that creates temporary links in the tree (threads) to emulate the traversal process.
    - Morris traversal is not commonly used for postorder traversal.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation (Recursive Approach):

Here's a Python function implementing the recursive approach:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def postorderTraversal(root):
    def recurse(node):
        if not node:
            return []
        return recurse(node.left) + recurse(node.right) + [node.val]
    
    return recurse(root)
```

This function is composed of two parts:
- A `TreeNode` class representing nodes in a binary tree.
- The `postorderTraversal` function which takes the root of the tree and returns a list of its values in postorder sequence.

The `recurse` is an inner function that performs the actual traversal. If the node it's called with is `None`, it returns an empty list. Then it calls itself on the left and right child if they exist and finally appends the current node's value.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's consider a simple binary tree:

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5
```

A postorder traversal would visit the nodes in the following order: 4, 5, 2, 3, 1.

Running `postorderTraversal(root)` where `root` is the root of the above tree, the output of the function would be:

```python
[4, 5, 2, 3, 1]
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

The recursive solution for postorder traversal has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because it visits each node exactly once.

The space complexity is also O(n), but this is a little more nuanced. In the worst case, the tree is completely unbalanced (e.g., a linked list), and the call stack used by the recursion will have a depth equal to the number of nodes. However, in a balanced tree, the average stack depth would be O(log n).

### Real-World Applications:

Postorder traversal finds its applications in scenarios where children nodes must be processed before their parent node. Some of those scenarios are:
- Expression tree evaluation, where you need to evaluate the operands before applying the operator.
- Filesystem cleanup processes, where you delete child directories before parent directories.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

A common pitfall with recursion-based tree traversal is not handling the base case correctly (when a node is `None`).

A trick with the iterative approach is using two stacks to simulate the postorder traversal, or you can use a single stack with a more complex state management.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem falls into the "Tree Traversal" category. Recognizing this pattern can help solve problems that involve visiting nodes of a tree in a particular order or to convert one type of depth-first traversal to another.
