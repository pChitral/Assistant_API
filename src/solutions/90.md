LeetCode Problem #90 is "Subsets II." Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the problem, followed by an in-depth explanation of the solution strategy, a detailed Python code explanation, examples, complexity analysis, real-world applications, common pitfalls and tricks, problem pattern identification, and links to similar problems.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

In the "Subsets II" problem, you are given an integer array `nums` that may contain duplicates. Your task is to return all possible subsets (the power set). The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets, and the subsets within the solution set must be returned in any order.

A subtle nuance of this problem as compared to the classic "Subsets" problem is the presence of duplicate elements in the input array. This means that simply generating all subsets would not suffice; we also need to ensure that duplicates within the power set are removed.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To generate all possible subsets, we can use a backtracking approach, which is a kind of depth-first search (DFS). Here's the typical strategy for generating subsets using backtracking:

1. Sort the input array to ensure that duplicates are adjacent, which makes it easier to skip over duplicates during the subset generation process.
2. Traverse the array, and for each element, choose to either include it in the current subset or exclude it.
3. Ensure that when we come across duplicates, we treat consecutive duplicate elements as a special case to avoid generating duplicate subsets.

Now, let's compare this with another method: iterative. In an iterative solution, we start with an empty list as the initial "power set"; for each number in the input, we add it to each currently existing subset to create new subsets. However, because of duplicates in the input array, this method could generate duplicate sets, which we would then need to filter out, resulting in higher complexity and reduced efficiency.

The backtracking approach is preferred for its efficiency in dealing with duplicates â€” we can prune the search space and skip generating the duplicate subsets in the first place.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's dive into the Python code implementing the backtracking approach:

```python
def subsetsWithDup(nums):
    def backtrack(start, path):
        # Add the current subset to the result
        res.append(path[:])
        # Explore further elements to make new subsets
        for i in range(start, len(nums)):
            # Skip duplicates
            if i > start and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
                continue
            # Include the current element in the path and backtrack
            backtrack(i + 1, path + [nums[i]])

    nums.sort()  # Sort the array to handle duplicates
    res = []
    backtrack(0, [])
    return res
```

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

- `subsetsWithDup(nums)`: This function generates all subsets without duplicates.
- `def backtrack(start, path)`: A helper function that generates subsets. It uses recursion to explore all possibilities.
  - `res.append(path[:])`: This appends a copy of the current path (which represents a subset) to the result. We create a copy with `path[:]` because the path will change as we backtrack.
  - `for i in range(start, len(nums))`: We iterate through the elements starting from the `start` index.
  - `if i > start and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]`: This is the crucial step that handles duplicates. If the current element is the same as the previous one and it's not the starting element of this path, we skip it to prevent duplicate subsets.
  - `backtrack(i + 1, path + [nums[i]])`: This is the backtracking step where we recursively call the function to explore further elements.
- `nums.sort()`: We sort the input array before backtracking to make duplicate elements adjacent.
- `res = []`: Initialize a list to store the subsets.
- `backtrack(0, [])`: Start backtracking from index 0 with an empty path.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's illustrate the solution with an example:

Given `nums = [1, 2, 2]`, after sorting the array becomes `[1, 2, 2]`.

- We start with an empty path `[]`, which is a subset by itself, so we add it to `res`.
- Next, we include the first element `1`, making the path `[1]`. We add it to `res`.
- Then, we include the second element `2`, making the path `[1, 2]`. We add it to `res`.
- We attempt to include the third element, which is also `2`, making the path `[1, 2, 2]`, and add it to `res`.
- We backtrack and consider the subsets that include the second element `2` but not the first element `1`: so, we add `[2]` and `[2, 2]`.
- Finally, `res` contains `[[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 2], [2], [2, 2]]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the backtracking approach is O(2^N) in the worst case, where N is the number of elements in the input array. This is because each element has two choices: either it is included in the subset or not. However, due to the handling of duplicates, the actual time complexity will often be less since we skip over subsets that would have been duplicates.

The space complexity is O(N) for the recursion stack. Additionally, if we consider the space needed to store all subsets, it would be O(2^N * N) since there are 2^N subsets and each subset can take up to N space.

### Real-World Applications

This problem can be applied to situations where you need to enumerate all combinations of a set with potential repetitions, such as generating all possible search queries from a list of keywords where some keywords might be synonyms.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Forgetting to sort the nums array can lead to incorrect results because you won't be able to effectively skip duplicates.
- It's easy to forget making a copy of the path with `path[:]` when adding to the results. If you directly add the path object, since it's mutable, all entries in your result will end up being the same reference and hence have identical contents after the final iteration.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The pattern for this problem is backtracking, which is a DFS strategy used to generate all possible solutions to a problem and construct solutions incrementally.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems

Similar problems that also employ backtracking or involve generating combinations or permutations include:

- Subsets (LeetCode 78)
- Permutations (LeetCode 46)
- Permutations II (LeetCode 47)
- Combination Sum (LeetCode 39)
- Palindrome Partitioning (LeetCode 131)

All these problems can be solved using backtracking where you build a solution step by step and backtrack when you detect that the current path won't lead to a solution or after adding a solution to your result set.
