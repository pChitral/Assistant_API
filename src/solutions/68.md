LeetCode Problem 68 is titled "Text Justification." This problem is about formatting text to given specifications and is therefore a string manipulation challenge. Below, I will break down the problem, discuss solution strategies, provide a detailed Python code explanation, give examples, analyze the time and space complexity, connect the solution to real-world applications, talk about common pitfalls and tricks, identify problem-solving patterns, and list related LeetCode problems.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The Text Justification problem requires us to format a list of words into a specific justification format for text. Here are the specifications given in the problem:

- Words in the text must be fully justified left and right.
- Each line other than the last must have as many words as possible and be spaced out to the width of maxWidth.
- The spaces between the words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If they cannot be evenly distributed, the extra spaces should be placed on the left.
- The last line must be left-justified and should not be spaced out to the maxWidth.
- Each line must be padded with spaces at the end if necessary to ensure it has exactly maxWidth characters.

We are required to return a list of strings representing the formatted text.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
To solve this problem, we typically follow these steps:
1. Greedily pick as many words as can fit in one line with at least one space between them.
2. Justify the words with the appropriate number of spaces:
    - Distribute spaces as evenly as possible when it's not the last line.
    - For the last line, just add a single space between words and add spaces at the end if necessary.
3. Repeat the above steps for all lines.

Let's go through the details of implementing this algorithm:
- Use a helper function to add spaces between words for a line.
- Track the number of characters on the current line and the list of words to include in that line.
- Iterate over the words, deciding which ones fit in the current line, and call the helper function to justify them as needed.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Now, let's write Python code that tackles all of the points above:

```python
def fullJustify(words, maxWidth):
    def justifyLine(line, maxWidth, isLast):
        # If it's the last line or contains only one word, left-justify
        if isLast or len(line) == 1:
            return ' '.join(line).ljust(maxWidth)
        # Calculate number of spaces
        totalSpaces = maxWidth - sum(len(word) for word in line)
        betweenSpaces, extra = divmod(totalSpaces, len(line) - 1)
        # Distribute extra spaces among the first 'extra' spaces
        for i in range(extra):
            line[i] += ' '
        # Join the words with the standard space count in between
        return (' ' * betweenSpaces).join(line)
    
    result, currentLine, numLetters = [], [], 0
    for word in words:
        if numLetters + len(word) + len(currentLine) <= maxWidth:
            currentLine.append(word)
            numLetters += len(word)
        else:
            result.append(justifyLine(currentLine, maxWidth, False))
            currentLine, numLetters = [word], len(word)
    
    # Add the last line and justify it
    result.append(justifyLine(currentLine, maxWidth, True))
    return result
```

Now let's break down this code.

1. `fullJustify` is the main function that takes the `words` list and `maxWidth` as parameters.
2. `justifyLine` is a helper function that justifies a single line. It takes any list of words (`line`), the `maxWidth`, and a boolean `isLast` to indicate if this is the last line.
3. Inside `justifyLine`, we first handle the case where the line is the last line or contains a single word by simply left-justifying it.
4. If it's not the last line, we calculate the `totalSpaces` needed and how to distribute them (`betweenSpaces`, `extra`).

The loop inside the `fullJustify` function is where we build each line, checking if adding a new word exceeds the `maxWidth`. If it does, we justify what we have so far and start a new line (`currentLine`). The number of characters is tracked by `numLetters`.

After iterating through all the words, we add and justify the last line. Finally, we return the list of justified lines (`result`).

### Elaborate Examples:
Let's execute the code with an example:
```python
words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
maxWidth = 16
```
- The first line can fit the words "This", "is", and "an".
- The second line can fit "example", "of", "text".
- The last line will just have "justification.".

Let's see the output:

```python
fullJustify(words, maxWidth)
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
Analyzing this implementation, we can derive the time and the space complexity.

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the total number of characters in all words. This is because we process each word once and do constant work per word. The join operation is linear with respect to the number of characters in the line, which is at most maxWidth.
- Space Complexity: O(n), as we create a list of lines and each line can have a length up to maxWidth. However, if we consider the output is required for the problem and cannot be counted towards the space complexity, the auxiliary space usage (space excluding input and output) is O(maxWidth), as we only keep the current line and a few integers for counting.

### Real-World Applications:
The problem of text justification has practical implications in word processing software and web content rendering where the layout of text must be controlled and made readable according to certain design constraints.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- Remember to account for the single space that is required between words when counting the length of a line.
- Ensuring the last line of text is left-justified rather than fully-justified is a common oversight.
- Distributing spaces can be tricky; ensure you handle cases with one word and the last line correctly.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
The problem involves greedy algorithms since we are greedily trying to fit as many words as possible into a line. Also, it's a simulation problem, where we carefully enact the rules provided.
