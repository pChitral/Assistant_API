LeetCode Problem #68 is titled "Text Justification". This problem is a classic example of string manipulation and formatting. Let's break down the problem, analyze the specifics, and then move into an in-depth discussion of how to approach a solution.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem statement gives us a list of words and a maxWidth, which is the length that every line of the resulting text should have. The task is to format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters, and is fully (left and right) justified.

Key points to consider:

- You should pack as many words as you can in each line.
- Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.
- Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible.
- If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the ones on the right.
- For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.
- A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
- Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
- The input array words contains at least one word.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

The solution to this problem involves careful iteration over the input list of words and assembling lines one at a time until all words have been processed. The following steps can be used to create a solution:

1. Initialize an empty list to hold the justified lines (`justified_lines`).
2. Iterate over the words, keeping track of the current line length.
3. For each word, decide whether to add it to the current line or to justify the current line and start a new one.
4. When the maximum width is reached or exceeded, justify the line by distributing spaces:
   - Calculate the total number of spaces needed.
   - Distribute the spaces evenly between words, handling the case where the distribution is not even.
5. Handle the last line differently, as it should be left-justified.
6. Return the list of justified lines.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

The Python code will be explained in detail, but let's write the solution first.

### Elaborate Examples:

The function will be tested with various examples after the code explanation, including edge cases such as a single very long word on one line, multiple short words, and the last line being treated differently.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

After the examples have been worked through, a detailed complexity analysis of both time and space will be made. We'll examine the number of operations relative to the input size and the memory consumption.

### Real-World Applications:

Text justification is a common task in word processing software, typesetting, and web design, where aesthetic and readability are important. It can also be found in terminal-based interfaces and printing software.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

Common pitfalls involve mishandling edge cases, such as the last line, or miscalculating space distribution. It's important to rigorously test the code with various inputs to ensure that all cases are correctly handled.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem can be categorized under string manipulation, formatting, and simulation. Recognizing how to traverse the input and simulate the justification process is key to solving the problem.
