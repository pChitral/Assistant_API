LeetCode Problem #9 is titled "Palindrome Number." The problem statement is as follows:

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

Key aspects of the problem include:
- The input is an integer `x`.
- The goal is to return `true` if `x` is a palindrome and `false` otherwise.
- A palindrome integer reads the same forward and backward.
- Negative numbers are not palindromes because the "-" sign does not reverse.
- The follow-up asks to solve the problem without using string conversion (typically string conversion would be an easy way to check for a palindrome).

There are several nuances to consider:
- A single-digit number is always a palindrome.
- The problem with negative numbers is the negative sign, which doesn't have a "mirror" on the other end.
- You might need to handle edge cases like integers with trailing zeros, as they cannot be palindromes because leading zeros are not allowed in integers.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

The general strategies for this problem can be divided into two approaches:

1. **String Conversion Approach**: Convert the integer to a string, and check if the string reads the same backward as forward. This can be achieved simply through string slicing.
2. **Mathematical Approach**: Reverse the digits of the number mathematically and compare the original number with the reversed number.

For the follow-up constraint, the mathematical approach is preferred since string conversion is prohibited. This requires reversing half of the number and comparing it with the other half.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Here's a Python function that solves the problem using the mathematical approach:

```python
def isPalindrome(x: int) -> bool:
    # Negative numbers are not palindromes.
    # Also, if the last digit of the number is 0, then to be a palindrome,
    # the first digit of the number also needs to be 0 which is only possible if the number is 0.
    if x < 0 or (x % 10 == 0 and x != 0):
        return False
    
    reversed_number = 0
    while x > reversed_number:
        reversed_number = reversed_number * 10 + x % 10
        x //= 10

    # When the length of the number is an odd number, we can get rid of the middle digit by reversed_number//10
    # For example, when the input is 12321, at the end of the loop we get x = 12, reversed_number = 123,
    # since the middle digit doesn't matter in palindrome, we can simply compare x with reversed_number//10
    return x == reversed_number or x == reversed_number // 10
```

Here's what the code does:

- First, it addresses the fast fail cases: if `x` is negative or ends with 0 (but is not 0), the number is not a palindrome.
- It initializes `reversed_number` to zero. This will build the reversed integer.
- It then enters a loop, which runs only as long as the original number `x` is greater than `reversed_number`. This ensures that we only reverse half of the number.
- During each iteration of the loop, it adds the last digit of `x` to `reversed_number`, multiplies `reversed_number` by 10, and reduces `x` by one digit.
- After the loop, if `x` has an odd number of digits, `reversed_number` will have the middle digit still attached. We remove it using integer division by 10.
- Finally, it compares `x` with `reversed_number` to check if the number is a palindrome.

### Elaborate Examples:

Using the function `isPalindrome` with the examples provided:

- `isPalindrome(121)` would return `true`. It will reverse only the `21` and compare it with `1`, effectively comparing `12` and `12`.
- `isPalindrome(-121)` would return `false` because of the fast fail check for negative numbers.
- `isPalindrome(10)` would return `false` due to the fast fail check for numbers ending with 0 that are not 0.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of the mathematical approach to solve this problem is O(log10(n)) because we are dividing the input by 10 for every iteration.

The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a fixed amount of space (just `reversed_number` and a few other variables), which does not scale with the input size.

### Real-World Applications:

Palindrome detection may seem like a puzzle, but it has various real-world applications, such as error detection in data transmission, bioinformatics (for finding palindromic sequences in DNA), and within algorithms for text editing software.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Forgetting to handle negative inputs and numbers with trailing zeros are common pitfalls.
- Avoiding unnecessary work by only reversing half the number is a useful optimization trick.
- Knowing when to stop (when the original number is less than or equal to the reversed half) is key to solving this problem correctly.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This is a mathematical manipulation problem combined with a digit-by-digit analysis to solve a logic puzzle. Recognizing how palindrome properties can be used to reduce the work (by only considering half of the number) is a central pattern in effective problem-solving for similar challenges.
