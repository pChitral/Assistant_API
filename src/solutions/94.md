LeetCode Problem 94 is titled "Binary Tree Inorder Traversal." Here's a comprehensive analysis and explanation of the problem.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
The problem asks for the inorder traversal of a binary tree and to return the inorder traversal as a list. In binary trees, an inorder traversal is one of the most common depth-first traversal techniques where you follow the sequence:

1. Traverse the *left subtree* recursively inorder.
2. Visit the *root* node.
3. Traverse the *right subtree* recursively inorder.

In simple terms, for each node, you first explore its left subtree, then visit the node itself (often to process, or in this case to collect the value), and finally, you explore its right subtree. This process will output the values of the nodes in a binary tree in the ascending order if the binary tree is a binary search tree.

The binary tree nodes are defined as shown below:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

Each `TreeNode` has an integer value `val`, and pointers to its `left` and `right` children.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
The inorder traversal can be approached using either iterative or recursive methods:

#### Recursive Method
The recursive method is a straightforward implementation of the inorder traversal algorithm:
- If the current node is null, return (base case for the recursion).
- Recursively traverse the left subtree.
- Visit the current node (e.g., append the node's value to a result list).
- Recursively traverse the right subtree.

This solution is easy to understand, and closely mimics the definition of inorder traversal.

#### Iterative Method
The iterative method uses a stack to simulate the recursive calls. The main steps are:
- Create an empty stack to maintain the traversal state.
- Start with the root node and push all the left children onto the stack.
- While the stack is not empty, pop a node from the stack, visit it, and if the popped node has a right child, push the right child and all its left children onto the stack.

Both approaches achieve the same goal but in different manners. The recursive method relies on the function call stack to keep track of the nodes, while the iterative method manages the traversal state explicitly with a stack data structure.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
I will demonstrate both recursive and iterative solutions, starting with the recursive:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def inorderTraversal(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
        def _inorder(node):
            if not node:
                return []
            return _inorder(node.left) + [node.val] + _inorder(node.right)
        
        return _inorder(root)
```
In this recursive solution, `_inorder` is a helper function that carries out the inorder traversal. If the current node is null, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it makes recursive calls to itself for the left subtree, visits the current node by including its value in the list, and then makes a recursive call for the right subtree. These lists are concatenated with the `+` operator and returned.

Now, let's look at the iterative solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def inorderTraversal(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
        stack = []
        result = []
        current = root
        while current or stack:
            # Reach the leftmost node of the current node
            while current:
                stack.append(current)
                current = current.left
            # Current must be None at this point
            current = stack.pop()
            result.append(current.val)
            # We have visited the node and its left subtree.
            # Now, it's right subtree's turn.
            current = current.right
            
        return result
```
In this iterative solution, we use a stack to keep track of the nodes. We initialize `current` to start at the root and a `result` list to store the visited nodes. In the main `while` loop, we first traverse as far left as possible, pushing each node onto the stack. When there are no left children, we pop the top node from the stack, visit it by adding its value to the `result` list, and then proceed to its right child if it exists, repeating the process.

### Elaborate Examples
To better understand these solutions, let's walk through an example:

```
    1
     \
      2
     /
    3
```

For this tree, an inorder traversal would visit the nodes in the order `[1, 3, 2]`.

Let's go through the iterative method:

- Push 1 to the stack.
- Since 1 has no left child, we pop 1 and append it to the result: `result = [1]`.
- Move to the right child of 1, which is 2, and push 2 to the stack.
- 2 has a left child, 3, so push 3 to the stack.
- Since 3 has no children, pop 3 and append it to the result: `result = [1, 3]`.
- Move to the right child of 3, which is null, so continue to the next iteration of the loop.
- Pop 2 from the stack and append it to the result: `result = [1, 3, 2]`.
- Since all nodes are visited, the `while` loop terminates, and we return `result`.

The recursive method would entail the following steps:
- Call `_inorder(1)`
  - Traverse left (which is null)
  - Visit 1, which puts `1` in the list
  - Call `_inorder(2)`
    - Call `_inorder(3)`
      - Traverse left (which is null)
      - Visit 3, which puts `3` in the list
      - Traverse right (which is null)
    - Visit 2, which puts `2` in the list
  - Combining these lists, we get `[1, 3, 2]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
For both the iterative and recursive methods:

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because every node in the tree is visited exactly once.
- Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This reflects the worst-case space taken up by the call stack (for the recursive method) or the explicit stack (for the iterative method). In the worst case of an unbalanced tree, this could be O(n).

### Real-World Applications
Inorder traversal is not just a theoretical exercise; it has practical applications. For example, in binary search trees, an inorder traversal retrieves the elements in sorted order, which can be used to sort elements, verify the correctness of a BST, or implement iterators over a BST.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks
When implementing either solution, it's crucial to consider the following:
- Handle the edge case when the root is null.
- Understand the difference between visiting a node and traversing a subtree.
- For the iterative solution, ensure not to get stuck in an infinite loop by managing the current node correctly.

### Problem Pattern Identification
The pattern identified here is `Depth-first Traversal`, particularly `Inorder Traversal` of a binary tree. Recognizing this pattern can help to solve a variety of tree problems that require visiting each node in a specific order.
