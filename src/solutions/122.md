LeetCode Problem 122 is titled "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II". This is a classical problem in algorithmic trading and dynamic programming. Let's start with an extensive problem breakdown.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The problem statement gives you an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`th day. The goal is to determine the maximum profit you can achieve by making as many transactions as you want, with the only constraint being that you must sell the stock before you buy again.

Here are some key points from the problem statement:

1. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
2. You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
3. No transaction fees or taxes are considered in the problem.
4. The prices array is guaranteed to have at least one day of stock prices.

With these considerations, we need to create an algorithm that can maximize profit from the stock prices given. One might initially think about the greedy approach to solve this problem. That is, every time we see a price that is higher than the previous one, we can consider it as a profit opportunity.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

A naive approach to this problem might involve complex analyses of price trends to determine the best days to buy and sell. However, a key insight simplifies the problem greatly: if we buy on one day and sell on the next day whenever there is a profit to be made, we will achieve the maximum possible profit.

This is because stock prices can be thought of as a graph, and the optimal profit can be obtained by summing up all the "ascending" parts of the graph. Why does this work? Because the sum of all individual profits of each ascending segment is equal to the profit we would make if we were to buy at the beginning of the first ascending segment and sell at the end of the last one.

#### Example:
```
For price array [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4], buying at 1 and selling at 5, buying at 3, and selling at 6 will give the same profit as buying at 1 and selling at 6.
```

Thus, the algorithm is pretty straightforward:
- Iterate through the `prices` array.
- At each step, if the current price is greater than the previous day's price, we take the difference as profit.
- Accumulate all such profits.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_profit = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prices[i - 1]:
                max_profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1]
        return max_profit
```

In this Python code, the `maxProfit` function:
- Initializes `max_profit` to `0` to keep track of the accumulated profit.
- Iterates through the list of prices starting from the second price (`i` starting from `1`).
- On each day (`i`), it checks if the current price is greater than the previous day's price.
    - If it is, it adds the difference between the two prices to `max_profit` (`max_profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1]`).
- After finishing the iteration through all the prices, it returns the `max_profit`.

### Elaborate Examples

```python
# Example 1:
prices1 = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]  # The input array of prices.
# Day 1: Do nothing because there is no previous price to compare.
# Day 2: Buy at price 1.
# Day 3: Sell at price 5. Profit = 4.
# Day 4: Do nothing (price went down).
# Day 5: Buy at price 3.
# Day 6: Sell at price 6. Profit = 3.
# Total Profit = 4 + 3 = 7.
# Expected output: 7

# Example 2:
prices2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Prices are continuously rising.
# The optimal strategy is to buy on day 1 and sell on day 5.
# However, this is equivalent to buying on day 1 and selling on day 2, buying on day 2 and selling on day 3, and so on.
# Total Profit = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 (each day's profit is 1).
# Expected output: 4
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the `prices` array. We iterate through the array once.

Space complexity: O(1), because we only used a constant amount of extra space (for the max_profit variable).

### Real-World Applications

This algorithm can be viewed as a simplified model for algorithmic trading where the transaction costs are omitted. Although real-world trading is far more complex, understanding the basics of maximizing profits through transaction sequences is essential in financial markets.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Not accounting for the possibility of continuous transactions: One must realize that multiple separate profitable transactions can have the same effect as holding a stock for a long duration.
- Misunderstanding the problem by thinking you need to find the single best day to buy and the single best day to sell. Rather, the goal is to accumulate profits over the course of multiple transactions.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem can be categorized within the "greedy algorithm" problems. It does not require keeping track of previous states (unlike in dynamic programming) as decisions can be based solely on the current and the next step's data.
