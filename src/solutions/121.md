LeetCode Problem 121 is titled "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock." Here is a detailed analysis of the problem:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

This problem involves an algorithmic challenge that requires you to maximize profit by choosing the best day to buy and sell a stock. The problem provides you with an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`-th day.

The goal is to find the maximum profit that can be achieved. You can complete at most one transaction, which means you can buy one and sell one share of the stock. You cannot sell a stock before you buy one, and you are looking to maximize the difference (sell price - buy price).

#### Restrictions and Nuances:

1. If no profit can be made, the function should return 0.
2. The input list represents the stock price over a series of days, and you want to find the best single buy-sell pair.
3. You must buy before you sell.
4. The input will have at least 1 price and at most 10^5 prices, with each individual price being a non-negative integer.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The problem can be approached in several ways:

#### 1. Brute Force

The brute force method would be to try every pair of buy-sell days to find the maximum profit. This would mean nested loops where you compare all possible buy-sell combinations. However, the time complexity of this approach is O(n^2), where n is the number of prices, making it inefficient for large inputs.

#### 2. One Pass

The idea here is to iterate through the price list once and keep track of the minimum price witnessed so far and the maximum profit that can be achieved. We continuously update the minimum price when a lower price is found, and at each step, we also calculate the profit that could be made if we sold the stock at the current price, updating the maximum profit when a higher profit is calculated.

This method has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it efficient for this problem.

#### Detailed Python Code Explanation

The optimal solution in Python using the One Pass method could look like this:

```python
def maxProfit(prices):
    min_price = float('inf')  # Initialize min_price to infinity
    max_profit = 0  # Initialize max_profit to 0
    
    for price in prices:
        # Update min_price if the current price is lower than the known minimum
        min_price = min(min_price, price)
        
        # Calculate the profit of selling at the current price given the min_price
        profit = price - min_price
        
        # Update max_profit if the current profit is greater than the known maximum
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        
    return max_profit
```

Each operation inside the loop serves a specific purpose:

- The `min()` function updates the `min_price` if a lower price is found.
- We calculate the potential `profit` by subtracting the `min_price` from the current price.
- The `max()` function updates the `max_profit` if the potential profit is greater.

#### Elaborate Examples

Consider the following scenarios:

- `prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]`. The optimal purchase would be at price `1` and sale at price `6`, leading to the maximum profit of `5`.
- `prices = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]`. It is never optimal to buy since the price only decreases, so the maximum profit is `0`.

#### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the one-pass solution is O(n) because it iterates over the list of prices once. The space complexity is O(1) because only two variables are maintained regardless of the size of the input.

### Real-World Applications

This problem metaphorically models any scenario where you're looking to maximize profit from a singular investment based on fluctuating values. This includes stock market investments, currency exchange, or commodity trading. The algorithm could be applied to historical data to determine the best time for a transaction within a given period.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- One common mistake is not accounting for the possibility of no profitable transactions. Your algorithm must handle cases where it is best not to engage in any transaction.
- Another pitfall is overcomplicating the problem by trying to use fancy algorithms or data structures when a simple linear scan suffices.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem follows the pattern of array manipulation and dynamic programming to a certain extent. Recognizing that you only need to track the minimum value and the maximum profit at each step is crucial and can be applied to similar problems involving profit maximization or min/max tracking during iteration.
