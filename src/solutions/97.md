LeetCode Problem #97 is known as the "Interleaving String" problem. Let's break down this problem in extensive detail.

### Problem Statement

Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, find whether `s3` is formed by an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`.

An interleaving of two strings `s1` and `s2` is a configuration where they are divided into non-empty substrings such that:

```
s3 = s1[0] + s2[0] + s1[1] + s2[1] + ... + s1[i] + s2[j] + ...
```

The interleaving maintains the relative ordering of characters within `s1` and `s2`.

#### Constraints
- `0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
- `0 <= s3.length <= 200`
- `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` consist of lowercase English letters.

#### Examples

Example 1:
```
Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc"
Output: false
```

Example 3:
```
Input: s1 = "", s2 = "", s3 = ""
Output: true
```

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, we need a strategy that can handle the recursive nature of interleaving. A recursive solution would be to check, at each step, if the next character in `s3` can be formed by either taking the next character from `s1` or `s2`. However, due to overlapping subproblems and the recursive nature, this approach can quickly blow up in terms of time complexity.

Hence, a better approach is to use dynamic programming. The idea is to construct a 2D matrix `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents whether the first `i` characters of `s1` and the first `j` characters of `s2` can form the first `i + j` characters of `s3`. 

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

We can use the following approach to build the `dp` matrix:

1. Initialize the matrix with the size `(len(s1) + 1) x (len(s2) + 1)`, and set `dp[0][0]` to `True` because an empty `s1` and `s2` can always form an empty `s3`.

2. Fill the first row of the `dp` matrix. `dp[0][j]` should be `True` if `dp[0][j-1]` is `True` and `s2[j-1] == s3[j-1]`.

3. Similarly, fill the first column. `dp[i][0]` should be `True` if `dp[i-1][0]` is `True` and `s1[i-1] == s3[i-1]`.

4. Fill the rest of the `dp` matrix using the following rule: `dp[i][j]` is `True` if either `(dp[i-1][j] is True and s1[i-1] == s3[i+j-1])` or `(dp[i][j-1] is True and s2[j-1] == s3[i+j-1])`.

5. Finally, return the value of `dp[len(s1)][len(s2)]`.

Here is the Python code implementing this strategy:

```python
def isInterleave(s1, s2, s3):
    if len(s1) + len(s2) != len(s3):
        return False
    
    dp = [[False] * (len(s2) + 1) for _ in range(len(s1) + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = True
    
    for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] and s1[i - 1] == s3[i - 1]
    
    for j in range(1, len(s2) + 1):
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] and s2[j - 1] == s3[j - 1]
    
    for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):
        for j in range(1, len(s2) + 1):
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] and s1[i - 1] == s3[i + j - 1]) or (dp[i][j - 1] and s2[j - 1] == s3[i + j - 1])
    
    return dp[len(s1)][len(s2)]
```

### Elaborate Examples

Let's walk through the Example 2:

```python
s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc"
```

After initializing, our `dp` matrix looks like this:

```
dp = [[True, False, False, False, False, False],
      [False, False, False, False, False, False],
      [False, False, False, False, False, False],
      [False, False, False, False, False, False],
      [False, False, False, False, False, False],
      [False, False, False, False, False, False]]
```

After filling the first row and column based on the characters matching `s3`, we get:

```
dp = [[True, False, False, False, False, False],
      [True, False, False, False, False, False],
      [True, True, True, False, False, False],
      [False, True, True, True, False, False],
      [False, False, True, True, True, False],
      [False, False, False, True, True, False]]
```

Now, we cannot just fill the next element because `s1[3] != s3[4]` and `s2[2] != s3[5]`. So `dp[3][2]` remains `False`. Following this process, we eventually learn that `s1` and `s2` cannot interleave to form `s3`, because `dp[5][5]` is `False`.

### Complexity Analysis

- *Time Complexity:* The algorithm runs in `O(n * m)` time, where `n` is the length of `s1` and `m` is the length of `s2`. This is because we need to compute the result for each of the `nm` entries in our 2D `dp` matrix exactly once.

- *Space Complexity:* The space complexity is also `O(n * m)` due to the 2D `dp` matrix that we construct.

### Real-World Applications

The "Interleaving String" problem and its solution techniques have real-world applications in scenarios that involve synchronization, merging streams of data without losing the sequence from individual streams (like interleaving video and audio packets), and checking whether a sequence can be obtained by merging two other sequences while preserving their original order (i.e., for data reconciliation).

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

Common pitfalls in this problem include:
- Not handling edge cases, such as one or both input strings being empty.
- Incorrectly initializing the `dp` matrix, which can lead to invalid outcomes.
- Not checking for the total length of `s1` and `s2` against `s3` at the beginning, which can lead to unnecessary computation.

Tricks to keep in mind:
- Use a boolean 2D array for the dynamic programming approach, as we're only interested in whether an interleaving is possible (True/False).
- Leveraging the fact that if `dp[i][j]` is True, the next True value can only be either in the same row or same column, not both.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem follows the dynamic programming pattern, specifically the 2D dynamic programming type, which is widely used in string manipulation problems that involve matching or interleaving sequences.
