LeetCode Problem 39 is titled "Combination Sum". The problem statement is as follows:

Given an array of distinct integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return a list of all unique combinations of `candidates` where the chosen numbers sum up to `target`. You may return the combinations in any order.

The same number from `candidates` may be chosen an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

It's important to note the following constraints and conditions:

1. The same number can be chosen multiple times.
2. Combinations are unique based on their frequency, not their order.
3. `candidates` contains distinct integers.
4. The target number must be met exactly by the sum of the combination.
5. All numbers, including the target, will be positive integers.

### Solution Strategy

The problem is a classic example of backtracking. The idea is to explore all possible combinations of numbers that add up to the target sum, and once we either find a combination that works or exceed the target sum, we backtrack and try a different combination.

Here's a step-by-step strategy on how to approach the problem:

1. **Sorting (Optional):** First, we can sort the `candidates` array. This isn't necessary for the algorithm to work, but it can help to optimize by allowing us to stop searching further when the current sum exceeds the target sum.

2. **Backtracking Function:** Create a helper function that will be used for backtracking. This function will take the starting index for `candidates`, the current combination of numbers, the remaining sum to achieve the target, and the final result list.

3. **Recursive Cases:**
   - If the remaining sum is zero, a valid combination is found. Add the current combination to the result list.
   - If the remaining sum is negative, since all numbers are positive, there's no need to continue exploring this path.
   - If the remaining sum is positive, iterate over the `candidates` starting from the current index and for each number, add it to the current combination and recursively call the backtracking function with the updated current combination and remaining sum.

4. **Avoiding Duplicates:** Because `candidates` may contain multiple identical elements, we iterate from the current index rather than starting over each time. This helps avoid repeats and ensures each candidate is used only in its respective call stack level.

5. **Base Case:** The backtracking terminates when all combinations have been tried.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Here's what a Python solution using backtracking would look like:

```python
def combinationSum(candidates, target):
    def backtrack(start, combination, total):
        if total == 0:
            result.append(combination[:])  # Make a copy of the current combination
            return
        elif total < 0:
            return  # Backtrack as the sum exceeded the target
        
        for i in range(start, len(candidates)):
            # Include the current candidate and proceed
            combination.append(candidates[i])
            backtrack(i, combination, total - candidates[i])  # Not 'i + 1' because we can reuse the same elements
            combination.pop()  # Backtrack

    candidates.sort()  # Optional for optimization
    result = []
    backtrack(0, [], target)
    return result
```

In the above code:
- `combination` is a list that holds the current selection of numbers.
- `total` is the remaining sum we need to achieve the target.
- `start` ensures that we only use numbers starting from the current index and onwards.
- `backtrack(0, [], target)` initializes the process.

### Complexity Analysis

Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the above solution:

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is O(N^(T/M + 1)), where N is the number of candidates, T is the target sum, and M is the minimal value among the candidates. This is because in the worst-case scenario, the algorithm needs to explore each combination of candidates up to the point where the sum equals the target.
  
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(T/M) for the recursion stack. In the worst-case scenario, where we get the target sum by adding the smallest number M each time, the depth of the recursion can go up to T/M. Plus, the space needed to store the result.

### Real-World Applications

The "Combination Sum" problem is similar to many real-world problems where you have to find all possible ways to achieve a certain goal with given resources or constraints. Some examples include:
- Finding all ways to provide change for a given amount using available denominations.
- Exploring all combinations of ingredients to achieve a specific nutritional value in a meal plan.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

Common pitfalls include:
- Not backtracking correctly, which can lead to missing some combinations or creating duplicates.
- Not handling the base cases properly, leading to infinite recursion or incorrect results.
  
Tricks to optimize or improve the algorithm:
- Sorting candidates to quickly stop the search when the sum exceeds the target.
- Using iterative approaches instead of recursion for environments where recursion depth is a limitation.

### Problem Pattern Identification

Recognizing that this problem involves building combinations and that each choice leads to a new set of subsequent choices is critical. It is a variation of a subset or combination generation problem, which is commonly solved by backtracking.
