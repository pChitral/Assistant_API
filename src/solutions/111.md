LeetCode Problem #111 is titled "Minimum Depth of Binary Tree". The problem falls under the category of Tree and Depth-first Search (DFS) or Breadth-first Search (BFS). Let's go through the various aspects of this problem.

### Problem Statement

The problem asks for the minimum depth of a binary tree, which is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node. A leaf is a node with no children.

Here's the formal definition given on LeetCode:

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

### Function Signature

The function signature provided in the problem is:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
```

### Inputs and Outputs

The input to the function is the root of a binary tree, and the output is an integer representing the minimum depth of the tree.

### Examples

Example 1:
- Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
- Output: 2
- Explanation: The shortest path to a leaf node is from the root (3) to one of its leaves (9), with only 2 nodes along the path. Hence, the minimum depth is 2.

Example 2:
- Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
- Output: 5
- Explanation: The tree is skewed to the right, and the shortest path is from the root down to the only leaf, with 5 nodes along the path.

### Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, there are generally two approaches:

#### DFS Approach

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a tree traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking. To find the minimum depth using DFS, you would recursively calculate the depth of both the left and right subtrees, and return the smaller one, plus one for the current node. One nuance to keep in mind is that in a situation where one of the subtrees of the current node is empty, you must return the depth of the other subtree plus one.

#### BFS Approach

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is another tree traversal algorithm that uses a queue to traverse the tree level by level, starting from the root. To find the minimum depth using BFS, you would traverse the tree level by level, and the depth of the first leaf node you encounter would be the minimum depth of the tree.

The BFS approach is often more efficient for this problem because it can stop as soon as it finds the first leaf node, while DFS always explores the entire tree.

### Python Code Explanation

We can take the BFS approach using a queue to implement the level order traversal:

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        
        queue = deque([(root, 1)])  # (node, depth)
        
        while queue:
            node, depth = queue.popleft()
            # Check if it's a leaf node
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                return depth
            if node.left:
                queue.append((node.left, depth + 1))
            if node.right:
                queue.append((node.right, depth + 1))
```

In this code, we start by checking if the root is None, in which case we return 0 as the depth of an empty tree. We then initialize a queue with a tuple containing the root and its depth (1). Inside the while loop, we pop the leftmost element of the queue, check if the current node is a leaf, and if so, return its depth. If it has children, we add them to the queue with the incremented depth. This process continues until we find a leaf node.

### Complexity Analysis

For both DFS and BFS approaches, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited once.

The space complexity for the DFS approach is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. However, the worst case (highly imbalanced tree) can degenerate to O(n).

For the BFS approach, the space complexity is O(w), where w is the maximum width of the tree (maximum number of nodes on a level). This is because we store only one level of the tree in the queue at a time.

### Real-World Applications

Finding the minimum depth of a binary tree might be a smaller part of a larger problem, such as optimizing search queries in hierarchical structures, networking algorithms to determine the minimum number of hops in a network, or decision tree analysis in machine learning models.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Edge case: An empty tree should return a depth of 0.
- When calculating depth for a node with a single child, remember to consider only the child that exists.
- To optimize the BFS approach, return immediately when the first leaf node is found.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem is a classic tree traversal problem that tests the understanding of DFS and BFS algorithms. Recognizing which traversal technique is better suited based on the problem can aid in solving similar tree-related problems.
