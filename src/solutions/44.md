LeetCode Problem 44 is titled "Wildcard Matching". This is a classic problem of pattern matching, which is quite common in text processing as well as in designing interpreters and compilers. The problem statement is as follows:

Problem Statement:
Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*' where:

- '?' Matches any single character.
- '*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Example 1:
Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".

Example 2:
Input: s = "aa", p = "*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' matches any sequence, including an empty sequence or "aa".

Example 3:
Input: s = "cb", p = "?a"
Output: false
Explanation: '?' matches 'c', but the second letter is 'b' which does not match 'a'.

In this problem, you are required to determine if the pattern matches the string exactly. This is a more complex version of regular expression matching, with the wildcard '*' playing a key role in the problem's complexity.

**Extensive Problem Breakdown:**
The key aspect of wildcard matching is handling the '*' wildcard, which can be particularly tricky because it can match an arbitrary number of characters including zero. This means that one has to consider multiple possibilities at each stage when a '*' is encountered.

Additionally, '?' wildcard requires a match of exactly one character, which simplifies the problem to some degree but still adds complexity when combined with '*' characters.

**In-Depth Solution Rationale:**
There are several ways to approach this problem, ranging from backtracking to dynamic programming:

1. **Backtracking:**
   - You can iterate over the string and pattern simultaneously, and whenever you encounter a '*', you try to match it with zero or more characters.
   - Backtracking occurs when a character following the '*' in the pattern does not match the string, prompting the algorithm to try a different number of characters for the wildcard.

2. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Implementing a bottom-up dynamic programming approach generally yields a more efficient solution.
   - You create a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents whether the first `i` characters in the string match the first `j` characters in the pattern.
   - You initialize `dp[0][0]` to `True`, meaning an empty pattern matches an empty string.
   - You fill in the table using the rules based on whether you encounter a '?', '*' or literal match.

**Detailed Python Code Explanation:**
We'll commonly see a solution in Python using dynamic programming due to its efficiency.
