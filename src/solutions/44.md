LeetCode Problem 44 corresponds to the "Wildcard Matching" problem. This is a classic problem of algorithm and dynamic programming, where the task is to determine if a given string matches a pattern that includes wildcard characters.

Here's the complete problem statement for "Wildcard Matching":

Given an input string (`s`) and a pattern (`p`), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for `'?'` and `'*'` where:

- `'?'` Matches any single character.
- `'*'` Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

The matching should cover the **entire input string** (not partial).

### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: s = "aa", p = "*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' matches any sequence.
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: s = "cb", p = "?a"
Output: false
Explanation: '?' matches 'c', but the second letter is 'a', which does not match 'b'.
```


### Constraints:

- `0 <= s.length, p.length <= 2000`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
- `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'?'` or `'*'`.

This problem can be approached in several ways, including recursion, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms. The complexity of the problem mainly arises from dealing with the `'*'` wildcard, which can represent any sequence of characters, including an empty sequence. This makes it necessary to consider multiple potential matches at the same time.

Let's go through an in-depth explanation of the various solution strategies:

1. **Recursion**: A naive recursive approach could be to try matching the string and pattern character by character. When a `'*'` is encountered in the pattern, the algorithm could branch out, trying to match zero or more characters of the string with the rest of the pattern.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: DP approaches are usually more efficient for this type of problem. The idea is to use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents whether the first `i` characters of the string match the first `j` characters of the pattern. The DP array is filled in based on whether the current characters match, and how the `'*'` and `'?'` wildcards should be handled.

3. **Greedy**: A greedy solution can be implemented by iterating over the strings and patterns while keeping track of the positions where a `'*'` occurs. If the remaining part of the pattern does not match, the algorithm backtracks to the last `'*'` and tries to match different sequences of characters.

4. **Iterative with Two Pointers**: Another solution could involve two pointers iterating over the string and the pattern, respectively. When a `'*'` is found, the algorithm remembers the location and tries to match the rest of the string and pattern. If a mismatch occurs later, the algorithm returns to the `'*'` and moves the pointer over the string forward by one.

These approaches will have different performances, with the greedy and the iterative two-pointer approach typically being faster than the recursive or brute-force methods.

The complexity analysis mainly focuses on time and space complexities:

- The DP approach has a time complexity of O(m*n) and a space complexity of O(m*n), where m is the length of the string 's' and n is the length of the pattern 'p'. Optimizations exist to reduce the space complexity to O(min(m,n)).

- For the greedy or the iterative approach, the time complexity is generally O(m*n), but it can be significantly less in practical scenarios, especially when there's a limited number of `'*'` characters in the pattern.

Each solution requires careful handling of the edge cases, such as patterns or strings being empty, patterns starting or ending with `'*'`, and multiple consecutive `'*'` characters in the pattern.

Furthermore, to avoid common pitfalls, one must ensure that the entire string is considered (per the problem statement) and correctly handle cases where a `'*'` appears at the end of the pattern.
