LeetCode Problem #150 is the "Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation" problem. Let's dissect it in depth.

### Problem Statement

The problem requires us to evaluate expressions in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), also known as postfix notation. In RPN, operators follow their operands, which allows the expression to be evaluated without the need for parentheses to denote operation precedence.

An RPN expression is provided as an array of strings. Each element in the array is either an integer or one of the four operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. It is guaranteed that the given RPN expression is always valid, which means the expression would always evaluate to a result, and there would not be any division by zero operations.

Here is an example of a simple RPN expression and its evaluation:

```
["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"] -> ((2 + 1) * 3) -> 9
```

The goal is to evaluate the given RPN expression and return the evaluation result.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, we can use a stack, which is quite suitable for processing RPN expressions. Here's the strategy:

1. **Initialization**: Create an empty stack.
2. **Processing**: Iterate over each token (string) in the array:
   - If the token is a number, push it onto the stack.
   - If the token is an operator, pop the top two elements from the stack, apply the operator, and push the result back onto the stack.
3. **Finalization**: After processing all tokens, the stack will contain one element, which is the result of the expression.

Using a stack helps manage the intermediate results as we proceed through the tokens, and the order of operations naturally flows from the postfix format of the expression.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's translate the above strategy into Python code:

```python
def evalRPN(tokens):
    stack = []
    for token in tokens:
        if token not in "+-*/":
            stack.append(int(token))
        else:
            # At this point, we know the token is an operator.
            # We pop the last two numbers to apply the operation.
            b = stack.pop()  # Operand 2
            a = stack.pop()  # Operand 1
            
            # Perform the operation
            if token == '+':
                stack.append(a + b)
            elif token == '-':
                stack.append(a - b)
            elif token == '*':
                stack.append(a * b)
            elif token == '/':
                # Division in RPN should truncate towards zero.
                stack.append(int(a / b))  # Truncate division in Python 3
    # The result is the last item on the stack.
    return stack.pop()
```

In the code, we iterate over each token. If it's an operand, we convert it to an integer (since the input is in string format) and push it onto the stack. If it's an operator, we pop the last two operands from the stack. It's important to note the order of operands when popped: the last popped element is used as the second operand (`b`) and the penultimate popped element as the first operand (`a`) because of the stack's LIFO (last in, first out) nature. We then carry out the operation and push the result back onto the stack.

### Elaborate Examples

Consider the expression: 

```
["4", "13", "5", "/", "+"]
```

The evaluation proceeds as follows:

- Push `4` onto the stack.
- Push `13` onto the stack.
- Push `5` onto the stack.
- Token is `/`: pop `5` and `13`, push `13 / 5` -> push `2` (since `/` in Python 3 with `int` results in floor division).
- Token is `+`: pop `2` and `4`, push `4 + 2` -> push `6`.
- Result: `6`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

**Time complexity**: 

- The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of tokens in the input list. Each token is processed exactly once.

**Space complexity**: 

- The space complexity is O(n) for the stack in the worst case, when all elements are pushed before an operation occurs.

### Real-World Applications

This problem is a representation of expression evaluation, which is a common task in calculators or in interpreting expressions in programming languages. Understanding how to evaluate expressions using stack can help in developing algorithms for parsing expressions, compilers, and interpreters.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

A common pitfall is to forget that the division operator in this problem should truncate towards zero. In Python 3, the `/` operator performs true division, and `//` performs floor division. However, the question specifies that we must truncate the result towards zero after division, which can be achieved by casting the result of `/` to `int` (assuming the arguments are integers, this correctly truncates towards zero for both positive and negative numbers).

### Problem Pattern Identification

Recognizing that a stack can effectively evaluate RPN expressions is an example of identifying the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) pattern, which is the fundamental property a stack operates on. Problems that involve reverse-order processing or have dependency on the most recent additions often lend themselves well to a stack-based approach.
