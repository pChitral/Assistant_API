LeetCode Problem 115 is titled "Distinct Subsequences," which is a problem in the domain of dynamic programming. Here is a detailed breakdown of the problem, which will be followed by in-depth explanations of potential solutions and their complexities.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The problem statement is as follows:

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the number of distinct subsequences of `s` that equal `t`. A string's subsequence is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

For example:

- If `s = "rabbbit"` and `t = "rabbit"`, the answer is `3`.
- If `s = "babgbag"` and `t = "bag"`, the answer is `5`.

The main challenges in this problem are:

1. Understanding what a subsequence is and the ways in which it can be formed.
2. Determining possible methods to count distinct subsequences without actually generating them.
3. Implementing an efficient algorithm that does not result in a time-out due to the potentially large input size.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, we must employ dynamic programming, which is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. The intuition behind the solution comes from noticing that the number of distinct subsequences in a string `s` up to index `i` that matches string `t` up to index `j` can be derived from:

1. The number of distinct subsequences in `s` up to `i-1` that match `t` up to `j` if `s[i]` does not equal `t[j]`.
2. The sum of the above value and the number of distinct subsequences in `s` up to `i-1` that match `t` up to `j-1` if `s[i]` equals `t[j]`.

This leads to the construction of a two-dimensional dynamic programming table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of distinct subsequences of `s[:i]` that equal `t[:j]`. Note that `s[:i]` implies substring of `s` from the beginning up to but not including index `i`.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

We will construct a dynamic programming table and iterate through both strings, updating the table according to the rules described.

```python
def numDistinct(s, t):
    m, n = len(s), len(t)
    # Create a 2D DP table with an extra row and column for empty substring cases.
    dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]
    
    # Base case initialization: an empty string t "" is a subsequence of any prefix of s.
    for i in range(m+1):
        dp[i][0] = 1
    
    # Fill in the DP table
    for i in range(1, m+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            # Copy the value from the top cell if characters don't match.
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
            # If characters match, add the value from the diagonal cell as well.
            if s[i-1] == t[j-1]:
                dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-1]
    
    # The bottom-right cell contains the number of distinct subsequences.
    return dp[-1][-1]
```

### Elaborate Examples

Let's take `s = "babgbag"` and `t = "bag"` as an example and fill the DP table:

```
   "" b a g
"" 1  0 0 0
b  1  1 0 0
a  1  1 1 0
b  1  2 1 0
g  1  2 1 1
b  1  3 3 1
a  1  3 4 1
g  1  3 4 5
```

Each cell in the table accumulates the count of distinct subsequences matching so far.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the algorithm is `O(m*n)`, where `m` is the length of string `s` and `n` is the length of string `t`, since we need to iterate through each character of `s` for every character of `t` to fill the DP table.

The space complexity is also `O(m*n)` due to the DP table size. However, we can optimize the space to `O(n)` by using only one row at a time, since each row only depends on the previous row.

### Real-World Applications

The problem of finding distinct subsequences is related to many real-world scenarios in bioinformatics, text processing, and pattern recognition, where such algorithms are used to match patterns allowing for deletions.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Remembering to initialize the base case correctly for an empty `t`.
- Ensuring that the indices are properly handled, since the table has one extra row and column compared to strings `s` and `t` indexes.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem can be identified as a classical dynamic programming problem, specifically dealing with sequence alignment which is quite common in bioinformatics.
