LeetCode problem number 109 is titled "Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree." Let's delve into the various aspects of this problem:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The given problem involves converting a singly linked list that is sorted in ascending order into a height-balanced binary search tree (BST). A height-balanced BST is one where the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than 1. The individual nodes of the linked list correspond to the values within the nodes of the resulting BST.

**Key Concepts**:
1. **Singly Linked List**: A data structure where each element has a value and a pointer to the next element.
2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where the left child of a node contains only nodes with values less than the nodeâ€™s value, and the right child only nodes with values greater than the node's value.
3. **Height-Balanced**: For any given node in the tree, the difference in heights of the left subtree and the right subtree is at most 1.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, we must keep in mind two crucial constraints:
1. The structure of the binary search tree must adhere to BST properties.
2. The tree must be height-balanced.

Here are a few strategies to convert the sorted list to a BST:

**Approach 1: Recursion with Array Conversion**
- Convert the linked list to an array. This allows us to access elements by index, which is useful for constructing the BST.
- Use a recursive approach to build the BST: Use the middle element as the root, recursively build the left subtree from the left subarray, and build the right subtree from the right subarray.
- Ensure the tree remains height-balanced by always choosing the middle element around which to center the subtree.

**Approach 2: In-Order Simulation**
- Since the linked list is sorted, we can simulate the in-order traversal. We know in-order traversal on a BST visits the nodes in ascending order.
- Recursively simulate the in-order traversal. Find the size of the list, and start constructing the left subtree with the first half of the elements, root with the middle element, followed by the right subtree with the remaining elements.

Approach 2 is generally more efficient as it does not require extra storage for array conversion.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Here is the Python code for approach 2 that simulates in-order traversal to build the BST:

```python
class Solution:
    def sortedListToBST(self, head):
        # This function finds the size of the linked list.
        def findSize(head):
            ptr = head
            size = 0
            while ptr:
                ptr = ptr.next
                size += 1
            return size
        
        # This recursive function will build the BST.
        def convertListToBST(left, right):
            nonlocal head
            # Base case when the pointers have crossed each other.
            if left > right:
                return None
            
            # Recursively build the left subtree.
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            left_child = convertListToBST(left, mid - 1)
            
            # Once left subtree is built, use the next node as the root.
            root = TreeNode(head.val)
            root.left = left_child
            
            # Move the head pointer to the next node.
            head = head.next
            
            # Recursively build the right subtree.
            root.right = convertListToBST(mid + 1, right)
            
            return root
        
        # We find the size and initiate the recursive function to build BST.
        size = findSize(head)
        return convertListToBST(0, size - 1)
```

Let's break down the code:
- `findSize` function iterates through the linked list to determine its size.
- `convertListToBST` is a recursive function that builds the BST. It uses the size of the list to determine the midpoint and recursively calls itself to build the left and right subtrees.
- `head` is updated each time we place a value in the BST to simulate in-order traversal, as `head` will keep pointing to the next node to be placed.
- Finally, the function `sortedListToBST` finds the size of the list and kicks off the recursive process.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's walk through an example where the linked list is `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`.

- The size of the list is 5.
- `convertListToBST` is called with `left = 0` and `right = 4`.
- `mid` is `2`, so node with value `3` becomes the root.
- Left subtree is built with `left = 0` and `right = mid - 1 = 1`. The midpoint of this is `0`, so node with value `1` becomes the left child.
- That subtree's right child is the next midpoint, `2` (`mid - 1 + 1`), so node with value `2` becomes the right child of node `1`.
- We then construct the right subtree of root `3`, recursively applying the same logic.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. We visit each node once.
- Space complexity: O(log N) due to the recursion stack during the construction of the BST.

### Real-World Applications

This problem demonstrates the transformation of one data structure into another, preserving the sorted order and balancing constraints. Such transformations are useful in optimizing search operations in applications like databases, filesystems, and any system where efficient data retrieval is crucial.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Mistakenly not updating the head of the linked list can lead to a wrong tree structure or infinite recursion.
- Not handling the base case in recursion can lead to stack overflow errors.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The pattern here is a divide-and-conquer approach where we divide the problem into subproblems and solve them recursively. Recognizing this pattern can help solve similar problems, such as constructing trees from sequences or arrays.
