LeetCode problem number 87 is titled "Scramble String." Here's a detailed analysis of this problem:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of the same length, the problem asks whether `s2` is a scramble of `s1`. A scramble string is a string that is created by following a recursive process:

1. If a string consists of only one letter, that string is considered a scramble string.
2. For any string with more than one letter, we can split it into two non-empty parts at any position within the string.
3. Swap the two parts and then proceed to recursively scramble each part.

The problem essentially asks us to determine if `s2` can be arrived at by applying these rules to `s1`. It's important to note that you can swap the parts obtained after splitting the string at any time or even choose not to swap them at all, which must be considered when constructing the recursion.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To approach this problem, we can consider the recursive definition of a scramble string. The most intuitive solution is to apply a recursion by trying each possible split and swap, and then checking if the resulting scrambled parts match `s2`. To optimize this, we can use dynamic programming or memoization to avoid recomputing the result for the same substrings.

Moreover, before doing all of the recursive splits, we can apply a few checks:
1. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is obviously a scramble of `s1`.
2. If the sorted characters of `s1` don't match the sorted characters of `s2`, then `s2` cannot be a scramble of `s1` because all the letters and their counts must match for one string to be a scramble of another.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Here is a Python function that uses recursion with memoization to solve the problem:

```python
def isScramble(s1, s2):
    memo = {}

    def dfs(s1, s2):
        if (s1, s2) in memo:  # Check if the result is already computed
            return memo[(s1, s2)]

        if len(s1) != len(s2) or sorted(s1) != sorted(s2):  # Pruning
            return False

        if s1 == s2:  # If both substrings are equal, it's a scramble
            return True

        for i in range(1, len(s1)):
            # Split and check without swap and with swap
            if (dfs(s1[:i], s2[:i]) and dfs(s1[i:], s2[i:])) or (dfs(s1[:i], s2[-i:]) and dfs(s1[i:], s2[:-i])):
                memo[(s1, s2)] = True
                return True

        memo[(s1, s2)] = False
        return False

    return dfs(s1, s2)
```

- `isScramble` defines a nested function `dfs` which employs depth-first search to explore all possible split positions recursively.
- The `memo` dictionary is used to store the results of previously computed string pairs; this serves as a cache to improve the efficiency by avoiding recomputation.
- Inside `dfs`, if the result for a given pair `(s1, s2)` is already computed and stored in `memo`, it is returned immediately.
- The `if` statement checks for inequality in sorted versions of `s1` and `s2` or their lengths as a quick failure case.
- If `s1` and `s2` are equal, we return `True` since they are trivially scrambles of each other.
- The loop iterates over possible split positions `i` from 1 to `len(s1) - 1`, and recursively checks two situations for each split: without swapping the parts (`s1[:i]` with `s2[:i]` and `s1[i:]` with `s2[i:]`) and with swapping (`s1[:i]` with `s2[-i:]` and `s1[i:]` with `s2[:-i]`).
- If either of these recursive checks returns `True`, we memoize the result and return it.
- If none of the splits results in a scramble, we mark the pair `(s1, s2)` in `memo` as not scramble and return `False`.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's consider two examples:

- **Example 1**: `s1 = "great"` and `s2 = "rgeat"`.
  - "great" can be split into "gr" + "eat".
  - These parts can be scrambled to get "rg" + "eat".
  - Now, the second part "eat" can be split as "e" + "at" and scrambled to get "ate".
  - Combining these, we get "rg" + "ate" which equals "rgeat".
  - So, `s2` is indeed a scramble of `s1`.

- **Example 2**: `s1 = "abcde"` and `s2 = "caebd"`.
  - There's no way to split and scramble "abcde" to get "caebd".
  - Although "abcde" can be split many ways and the parts scrambled, none will result in "caebd".

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the naive recursive approach can be as bad as O(2^n) as at each step, we're making a decision whether to swap or not, and this decision is made recursively. However, with memoization, many calls are cached which significantly reduces the total number of states we have to compute. The total unique states can be approximately O(n^2), where n is the length of the strings.

The space complexity is O(n^3) due to three main factors:
1. The recursive call stack that can go as deep as the length of the strings (O(n)).
2. The `memo` dictionary can have at most O(n^2) keys because there are n possible starting points and n possible lengths for each substring.
3. Each key in `memo` is a tuple containing two strings, each at most the length of the input strings (O(n)), although this does not stack multiply as strings are immutable and can be re-used by reference.

### Real-World Applications

The scramble string problem is abstract but has real-world applications in areas like data cryptography and obfuscation, where data might be intentionally scrambled for purposes of security and later unscrambled using a key or algorithm. It also has implications in the field of genetics, where DNA sequences may undergo transformations that are biologically similar to the scrambling operation.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

A common pitfall is to attempt a brute-force recursive solution without memoization, which results in repeated calculations and a slower solution that might not complete within reasonable time limits.

One trick to optimize the problem is to include the pruning steps before diving into the recursion, which leads to early rejections of some recursive paths.

Another tip is to ensure that you consider all possible split positions within the strings and to check both the swapped and non-swapped cases at every recursion level.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The problem falls under the category of dynamic programming (involving overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure) and recursive problem solving. Recognizing when to apply memoization or dynamic programming is critical in optimizing recursive solutions for problems with overlapping subproblems like this one.
