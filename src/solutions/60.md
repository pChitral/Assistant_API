LeetCode problem number 60 corresponds to the "Permutation Sequence" problem. Here is an extensive breakdown of the problem, along with in-depth solution strategies, code explanations, examples, complexity analysis, real-world applications, common pitfalls and tricks, and related problems.

**Problem Description:**

The problem "Permutation Sequence" asks to find the kth permutation sequence of the first `n` natural numbers, considering that these numbers start from 1 to `n`. We have to return the kth permutation sequence as a string, not as a list or array of numbers. The given `n` will be between 1 and 9 (inclusive), and `k` will be between 1 and `n!` (inclusive), where `n!` denotes the factorial of `n`.

This means that if `n = 3`, the permutations in order are:

1. "123"
2. "132"
3. "213"
4. "231"
5. "312"
6. "321"

**Extensive Problem Breakdown:**

Before solving, it is crucial to understand how permutations are generated. They follow a lexicographic (dictionary) order if generated using an algorithm like the next permutation (which repeatedly finds the next permutation in lexicographic order). 

The problem can be broken down into finding the kth permutation without generating all of the previous permutations to save on time and space complexity.

We need to recognize that there are (n-1)! permutations that start with a given number. Similarly, there are (n-2)! permutations that follow the selected first number and additional fixed second number, and so on.

**In-Depth Solution Rationale:**

A brute-force solution would generate all possible permutations and then select the kth one. However, this would be very inefficient with a time complexity of O(n! * n), because generating each permutation takes O(n) time.

To find a more efficient solution, we can utilize the properties of permutation. Since we know the count of permutations that share the same starting digit, we can calculate which digit will be at the first position of the kth permutation by dividing `k` by `(n-1)!`. The result of this division will give us the index in the list of available numbers for the first digit. We then decrease `k` by the number of permutations we have skipped and repeat the process to find the next digits.

**Detailed Python Code Explanation:**

Let's create a function that implements this logic.

```python
import math

def getPermutation(n, k):
    # Initialize the numbers and result
    numbers = list(range(1, n + 1))
    result = []
    k -= 1 # Since the list is zero-indexed
    
    while n > 0:
        # Find the index of the current digit
        index, k = divmod(k, math.factorial(n-1))
        result.append(str(numbers[index]))
        # Remove used number
        numbers.pop(index)
        n -= 1

    # Join result and return
    return ''.join(result)
```

The function `getPermutation` starts by initializing a `numbers` list which contains all numbers from 1 to n. The result variable is an empty list that will hold the digits of our resulting permutation in string form.

We then enter a loop that runs until our list `numbers` is empty. In each iteration we calculate the index of the current digit by dividing `k` by `(n-1)!` using `divmod`, which also gives us the new `k` for the next iteration. We append the found digit to `result`, remove it from `numbers`, and decrease `n` by one.

Finally, we join the list `result` into a string and return it.

**Elaborate Examples:**

Consider `n = 4` and `k = 9`, to find the 9th permutation:

- There are `3!` permutations for each starting digit.
- `9 / 3! = 1` R `3`, so the first digit is `2` because index `1` in `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is `2`.
- New k is `3`. Remaining numbers: `[1, 3, 4]`.
- `3 / 2! = 1` R `1`, so the second digit is `3`.
- New k is `1`. Remaining numbers: `[1, 4]`.
- `1 / 1! = 1` R `0`, so the third digit is `4`.
- Remaining number is `1`.

So the 9th permutation is "2341".

**Thorough Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity for this solution is O(n^2). This is because, for each of the n digits, we perform an operation that could be O(n) in the worst case due to the `pop` operation on the list `numbers`, which, in the worst case, involves shifting all elements one position.

The space complexity is O(n), as we store the permutation in a list with n elements and another list `numbers` of n elements.

**Real-World Applications:**

This problem can be applied in situations where we need to generate a specific permutation or arrangement without the need for all previous arrangements. It can be useful in cryptography, games, generating test cases, etc.

**Common Pitfalls and Tricks:**

A common pitfall is to attempt to generate all permutations when only one specific permutation is needed, which leads to unnecessary computations and a significant increase in time complexity.

**Problem Pattern Identification:**

This problem falls under the category of mathematical computation and combinatorics, and specifically, it is an application of factorial number system (also known as factoradic) and permutation generation.
