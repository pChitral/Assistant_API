LeetCode problem number 60 is titled "Permutation Sequence." This is a medium difficulty problem that asks you to find the k-th permutation sequence of a set of n numbers without having to generate all possible permutations.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem statement specifies that given two integers n and k, you need to return the k-th permutation sequence of the numbers [1, 2, ..., n]. It's important to understand that these permutations are supposed to be listed in lexicographic (dictionary) order, which means that the first permutation would be the numbers in ascending order, and the last permutation would have the numbers in descending order.

You must also consider that the intended solution for this problem should avoid generating all permutations due to the factorial time complexity, which would be impractical for larger values of n. Instead, the problem requires a more optimized approach, which involves generating only the k-th permutation directly.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

The key insight for an efficient solution hinges on understanding the structure of permutation sequences and making use of factorial number systems, or factoradics. Factorial number systems are helpful in this scenario as they allow you to determine the index of each digit in the k-th permutation without generating all permutations.

Here are the steps to find the k-th permutation sequence:

1. Precompute factorials of numbers up to n, as they are needed to find the indices of the numbers in the permutation.
2. Adjust k to be zero-indexed, as the permutation sequences in mathematical terms are usually 1-indexed.
3. Keep an array of the available numbers to add to the permutation sequence.
4. For each position in the sequence from 1 to n, compute the index of the number to place at that position:
   - The index is obtained by dividing (k - 1) by the factorial of the remaining length.
   - Append the number at that index to the sequence.
   - Update k by taking the modulus of k and the factorial of the remaining length.
   - Remove the number from the list of available numbers.
5. Repeat step 4 until all positions in the sequence are filled.

This process will yield the exact k-th permutation without having to enumerate all permutations.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's implement the Python code for the solution based on the rationale discussed:

```python
def getPermutation(n, k):
    # Step 1: Calculate the factorials up to n and initialize the list of numbers
    factorials = [1]
    numbers = [str(i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n):
        factorials.append(factorials[-1] * i)
        
    # Step 2: Decrement k for zero indexing
    k -= 1
    
    # Step 3: Build the k-th permutation sequence
    answer = []
    for i in range(n):
        # Step 4: Find the index for the current position
        idx = k // factorials[n - 1 - i]
        answer.append(numbers.pop(idx))
        
        # Step 4 (continued): Update k
        k %= factorials[n - 1 - i]
    
    return ''.join(answer)
```

In this code, `factorials` holds the precomputed factorial values, and `numbers` contains the list of available digits. The `for` loop iterates over each digit position to build the permutation string.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's consider the example where `n = 3` and `k = 3`.

The permutations in lexicographic order are: "123", "132", "213", "231", "312", "321". We need to find the 3rd permutation.

Using the algorithm:

- Compute factorials: `[1, 1, 2]`
- Convert k to zero-index: `k = 2`
- For i=0, idx = 2 // 2 = 1, answer = ["2"], numbers = ["1", "3"], k = 2 % 2 = 0
- For i=1, idx = 0 // 1 = 0, answer = ["2", "1"], numbers = ["3"], k = 0
- For i=2, idx = 0 // 1 = 0, answer = ["2", "1", "3"]

The 3rd permutation is "213".

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: The time complexity is O(n^2). The O(n^2) arises because there's an O(n) loop over the sequence's positions, and within that loop, the numbers list is manipulated (specifically, elements are popped by index), which also takes O(n) time in the worst case (as popping from the middle of a list can take O(n) time).

Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(n) because of the storage required for the factorials and the numbers list.
