LeetCode problem number 81 is "Search in Rotated Sorted Array II," which is a follow-up to the problem "Search in Rotated Sorted Array." This problem adds complexity to the original by allowing duplicates within the array, which can affect the binary search approach. Here's a breakdown of the problem and how to solve it.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

Imagine an array of integers that was initially sorted in ascending order, then some numbers at the beginning of the array got moved to the end, creating a rotation. The task is to determine if a given target value exists in such a rotated array. The catch here is that the array may contain duplicates, which means that simply comparing values at the middle and ends of the array may not be sufficient to decide which part of the array to continue the search in.

An example input array could look like this: `[1, 1, 3, 1]`, which seems like it's been rotated. If we're looking for the target `3`, we have to figure out a way to navigate through the duplicates.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

One approach is to linearly iterate through the array to find the target, which would have a time complexity of O(n). However, this approach does not leverage the sorted and rotated characteristics of the array.

A binary search algorithm, which has a logarithmic time complexity of O(log n) in the best case, is more efficient. This problem, however, needs a modification of the regular binary search because of the presence of duplicates.

#### Approach:

1. Start with regular binary search, with two pointers marking the start and end of the search range.
2. Check if the middle element is the target. If yes, return `True`.
3. If elements at start, middle, and end are equal, we cannot determine the pivot part; hence, we reduce the search space from both ends and continue.
4. Determine which part of the array is in proper sorted order by comparing start, middle, and end elements.
5. Finally, decide whether to bring our search to the left or the right portion of the array based on the target's value.

Because of duplicates, we need to consider cases where a regular binary search would mislead us into the wrong half of the array.

#### Example:

Consider an array `[2, 5, 6, 0, 0, 1, 2]` and a target of `0`:
- The middle element is `0`, so we've found our target.

However, if the middle element were `5`, and the start element were also `5` (as in the array `[5, 5, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`), we couldn't be sure if the pivot point is to the left or right of the middle. 

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's implement this approach in Python.

```python
def search(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return True

        # If we can't decide where the pivot is.
        if nums[left] == nums[mid] == nums[right]:
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        # If the left half is sorted.
        elif nums[left] <= nums[mid]:
            if nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        # If the right half is sorted.
        else:
            if nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
    return False
```

Here's the breakdown of the code:

- We start with setting `left` and `right` pointers at the beginning and end of the array.
- Through each iteration of the while loop, we calculate `mid` as the index halfway between `left` and `right`.
- We check if `nums[mid]` is equal to the target and return `True` if they match.
- If the elements at `nums[left]`, `nums[mid]`, and `nums[right]` are all the same, we increment `left` and decrement `right` to skip over the duplicates.
- If the left half is non-rotated (sorted), we check if the target is within the range of the left half. If it is, we move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`, otherwise, we move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.
- If the left half is rotated, we're sure that the right half is sorted. We then check if the target is within the right half's range, and adjust our pointers accordingly.
- The loop continues until `left` passes `right`, meaning the target is not present in the array. Then the function returns `False`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n) in the best case which is when there are no duplicates, but it degrades to O(n) in the worst case, when the array has many duplicates since we might need to move one step at a time through the duplicates.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we're only using constant additional space for the pointers and variables, regardless of the size of the input array.

### Real-World Applications:

This type of search algorithm can be useful in instances where quick searching is important, but some ambiguity might exist in the dataset, such as repeated values or data that have been partially transformed in some predictable way.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Not properly handling duplicates can lead to the wrong part of the array, making this problem tricky in the presence of duplicates.
- It's vital to cover edge cases where all numbers are duplicates, or where the target is at the start or end of the array.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem exemplifies a situation where a binary search is complicated by the presence of duplicates and requires additional checks. Anytime a binary search is used in a slightly modified scenario can be seen as a variation of this pattern.
