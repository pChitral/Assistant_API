LeetCode problem number 13 is `"Roman to Integer"`. The problem statement is as follows:

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 15`
- `s` contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
- It is guaranteed that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.

To solve this problem, one approach is to iterate through the string of roman numerals, convert each symbol to its value, and add it to the total. However, if a smaller value precedes a larger value, we must subtract the smaller value from the total instead of adding it. Let's discuss the solution strategy in more detail.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

#### 1. Mapping Roman Numerals to Integers
The first step is to create a dictionary that maps each Roman numeral symbol to its corresponding integer value, as provided in the problem statement.

#### 2. Translate Roman Numerals to Integer Values
- Initialize a variable to hold the sum of integers corresponding to the Roman numeral.
- Traverse the string from start to end.
- In each iteration, compare the current Roman numeral with the numeral immediately following it.
- If the current numeral is greater than or equal to the next numeral, add its value to the sum.
- If the current numeral is smaller than the next numeral, subtract its value from the sum (since this represents a case like IV or IX).
- If we are at the last numeral, just add its value to the sum since there is no next numeral to compare it with.

#### 3. Return the Result
The sum now contains the integer value of the Roman numeral. Return this value.

### Example:
Let's walk through an example to understand this approach better.

Input: `"MCMXCIV"`

- M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90, IV = 4
- The sum would be 1000 (M) + 900 (CM) + 90 (XC) + 4 (IV) = 1994.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
```python
def romanToInt(s: str) -> int:
    # Create a dictionary to map Roman numerals to integers
    roman_to_int = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}
    
    # Initialize an integer to hold the final result
    total = 0
    
    # Iterate over the string of Roman numerals
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # If we're at the last character, or the current character represents a value greater than or equal to the next one...
        if i == len(s) - 1 or roman_to_int[s[i]] >= roman_to_int[s[i + 1]]:
            total += roman_to_int[s[i]] # ...then add its value to the total.
        else:
            total -= roman_to_int[s[i]] # Otherwise, subtract its value from the total.

    # Return the final result
    return total
```

### Time Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string containing the Roman numeral. This is because we traverse the entire string once.

### Space Complexity Analysis:
The space complexity is O(1), since the dictionary that stores the Roman numeral mappings uses constant space, and the only other variable used is the integer to hold the total value.

### Real-World Applications:
This algorithm can be useful in any domain that requires the conversion of Roman numerals to their integer form, such as in historical documentation analysis, games, educational software, or user interfaces that need to support Roman numerals.

### Common Pitfalls:
Watch out for cases where a smaller numeral comes before a larger numeral, as these require subtraction rather than addition. Make sure to cover the edge cases in the input string, such as an empty string or a string with all numerals in descending order.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem follows the pattern of string traversal and mapping characters to values. Similar problems involve translating from one representation to another using mappings and recognizing special cases in the traversal (like the subtractive notation in Roman numerals).

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:

Some similar LeetCode problems include:
- LeetCode Problem 12: "Integer to Roman" (the reverse of this problem).
- LeetCode Problem 273: "Integer to English Words" (translating integers to their word representation).
- LeetCode Problem 482: "License Key Formatting" (formatting strings based on certain rules).

In each of these problems, mapping values to different representations and careful string traversal are key aspects of the solution, much like in Problem 13.
