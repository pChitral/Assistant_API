LeetCode Problem 13 is titled "Roman to Integer." The problem is about converting a Roman numeral to an integer. Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M.

Here's the specifics of the Roman numerals:

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

In Roman numerals, two things are important to keep in mind: 

1. Normally, Roman numerals are written from largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. As the one is before the five, we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX.
2. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
   - I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
   - X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
   - C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a Roman numeral, the task is to convert it to an integer. A string is given, and you must convert it to the integer it represents.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The basic strategy to solve this problem is to iterate through the given Roman numeral and sum the value of each symbol. However, we must handle the cases where subtraction is involved. To efficiently handle this, we can:

1. Map each Roman numeral symbol to its integer value.
2. Scan through the Roman numeral from left to right, adding the value of each symbol to a running total.
3. Check if the current symbol is less than the symbol to its right. If it is, we subtract its value twice because we have already added it once, and we need to negate the addition to account for the subtraction rule.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's say we are given the Python function `romanToInt(s)`, and we want to implement it:

```python
def romanToInt(s):
    roman_map = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}
    total = 0
    
    # We iterate through each Roman numeral character
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # If the current value is less than the next value, subtract twice the current value
        if i < len(s) - 1 and roman_map[s[i]] < roman_map[s[i + 1]]:
            total -= 2 * roman_map[s[i]]
        
        # Add the value of the current Roman numeral to the total
        total += roman_map[s[i]]
    
    return total
```

In this code:
- We first create a dictionary `roman_map` that maps each Roman numeral symbol to its integer value.
- We initialize `total` to 0 to keep track of the running total.
- We loop over the input string `s`, using `for i in range(len(s))` to index each character.
- Inside the loop, we check if `roman_map[s[i]]` is less than `roman_map[s[i + 1]]`, and if so, we subtract twice the value of the current numeral from the total, because we're in a subtraction case.
- In every iteration, we add the value of the current Roman numeral to the total since that's what we would normally do if there wasn't a subtraction rule.
- Finally, we return `total`.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's look at some examples:

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
```
The function would iterate over each 'I' and add 1 to the total each time, resulting in 3 since there's no need to subtract.

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "IV"
Output: 4
```
The function recognizes that 'I' is followed by 'V'. Thus, it subtracts 2 * 1 (2) because 'I' was added earlier and then needs to be subtracted to correctly form 4. The 'V' adds 5, so the total is 4.

Example 3:
```
Input: s = "IX"
Output: 9
```
Similar to Example 2, 'I' gets subtracted and 'X' adds 10. The total is therefore 9.

### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the Roman numeral string. We simply iterate through the string once.

The space complexity is O(1) since the storage used, a dictionary with a fixed number of Roman numeral mappings, does not increase with the size of the input string.

### Real-World Applications

Roman numerals are often seen in various places such as clock faces, book chapter enumerations, and movie release years. Being able to convert them to integers programmatically can be useful in various applications where processing or indexing such information is required, such as in databases or when sorting items in collections.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

A common mistake is to overlook the subtraction rule for Roman numerals and simply add up all of the numerical values. This will lead to incorrect results for numerals like 'IV' or 'IX'. The trick is to check the value of the current numeral against the value of the one following it and subtract if necessary.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem introduces the pattern of value mapping and sequential comparison within a string. Recognizing how adjacent characters can affect computation is a common pattern in string processing tasks, which can be beneficial when solving similar problems.
