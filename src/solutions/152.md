LeetCode Problem 152 is titled "Maximum Product Subarray." Here's a detailed analysis of the problem:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
Given an integer array `nums`, the task is to find the contiguous subarray within the array that has the greatest product and return the product. A subarray is a slice from a contiguous portion of an array, which means the numbers in the subarray are consecutive in the sequence of numbers in the given array.

Key aspects of the problem:
- The array can contain both positive and negative integers, as well as zeros.
- The size of the array is at least 1 and at most 20,000.
- The integers are within the range of 32-bit signed integer.

Because the array may contain negative numbers, the product of two negative numbers becomes positive, and hence the problem cannot trivially be solved by a simple iteration looking for the highest positive subarray product. The presence of zeros further adds complexity because a zero effectively resets any product computation to 0.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
A brute force solution to this problem would require checking the product of all possible contiguous subarrays, which would have a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. However, this is not efficient enough for arrays that can have up to 20,000 elements.

A more efficient solution uses dynamic programming, which can solve the problem in O(n) time. The key insight is that we need to keep track of both the maximum and minimum product at each position in the array because the minimum product (which will be negative) could become the maximum if it is multiplied by a negative number.

The algorithm iterates over the array and computes max product and min product up to that point using the following state transition:
- `max_prod = max(current_number, max_prod * current_number, min_prod * current_number)`
- `min_prod = min(current_number, max_prod * current_number, min_prod * current_number)`

At each iteration, the algorithm updates the global maximum product seen so far.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

```python
def maxProduct(nums):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the max product
    # and the running maximum and minimum products.
    global_max = prev_max = prev_min = nums[0]
    
    for num in nums[1:]:  # Start iterating from the second number
        # As we are including the current number in our subarray,
        # we must decide whether to take it alone or multiply it with the previous max or min.
        # This is because a negative number could turn a min product into a max.
        candidates = (num, prev_max * num, prev_min * num)
        curr_max = max(candidates)
        curr_min = min(candidates)
        
        # Update the global max product if the current max is greater.
        global_max = max(global_max, curr_max)
        
        # Update the previous max and min for the next iteration.
        prev_max, prev_min = curr_max, curr_min

    # After processing all numbers, global_max will have the result.
    return global_max
```

Line by line analysis:
- We first initialize `global_max`, `prev_max`, and `prev_min` to the first number in the array because the max product subarray could start at any index, including the first.
- We iterate through the `nums` array starting from the second element.
- At each element, we calculate potential new products by multiplying the current element with both the previously recorded max and min products, and also consider the current element itself as a standalone product. We do this because a large positive or negative number can either enhance the max product or turn a min negative product into a max positive product.
- We then update our `global_max` whenever we find a new max product.
- We also have to maintain the state of both `prev_max` and `prev_min` to carry on the information for the next iteration.
- Once we've iterated through all elements, `global_max` will contain the maximum subarray product.

### Elaborate Examples:
Consider the array `nums = [2, 3, -2, 4]`, the function processes as follows:

- At the start, `global_max`, `prev_max`, `prev_min` are all initialized to `2`.
- Then it checks `3`, and computes:
  - `candidates = (3, 2 * 3, 2 * 3)` which is `(3, 6, 6)`. Now `prev_max = 6` and `prev_min = 3`.
- Next is `-2`, computes:
  - `candidates = (-2, 6 * -2, 3 * -2)` which is `(-2, -12, -6)`. Now `prev_max = -2` and `prev_min = -12`.
- And lastly `4`, computes:
  - `candidates = (4, -2 * 4, -12 * 4)` which is `(4, -8, -48)`. Now `prev_max = 4` and `prev_min = -8`.
- Throughout the computation, `global_max` is updated to `6` after the second iteration and remains there.

The final `global_max` is `6`, which is the product of the subarray `[2, 3]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: Since we iterate through the array only once, and at each step, we perform a constant number of operations, the time complexity is O(n).
- Space Complexity: We only use a fixed number of variables regardless of the input size; thus, the space complexity is O(1).

### Real-World Applications:
This problem mimics real-world scenarios where you have sequences of factors (like financial growth rates) that can be positive or negative, and you want to find the best contiguous sequence (product) that contributes to the greatest growth (or loss if negative).

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
Common pitfalls include not properly handling negative numbers and zero values. It's essential to remember that a negative number can flip the sign of the product, and a zero resets your product calculations.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem falls under the dynamic programming category, particularly because it exhibits both optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems which can be solved once and reused later.
