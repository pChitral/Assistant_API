LeetCode Problem 43 is titled "Multiply Strings." This problem falls under the category of string manipulation and is designed to test one's understanding of basic arithmetic operations without using built-in language features for handling large numbers which would normally make this task trivial.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The problem statement is as follows: Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represented as strings, return the product of `num1` and `num2`, also represented as a string.

Notable constraints and nuances of the problem:
- The length of both `num1` and `num2` is < 200.
- The numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
- You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

This problem essentially asks you to implement the multiplication of two numbers exactly as it is taught in elementary school, where you multiply each digit of one number by each digit of the other number and sum the intermediate results appropriately.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
Since the direct conversion of strings to integers is not allowed, we need to simulate the multiplication process.

The general algorithm:
1. Initialize an array `result` that can hold the maximum possible number of digits in the output (length of `num1` + length of `num2`).
2. Iterate through each digit in `num1` and `num2` in nested loops, multiplying the digits at the current indices.
3. Update the `result` array at the corresponding indices.
4. Handle carry over if the multiplication results in a number greater than 9.
5. Convert the `result` array into the final string, taking care to skip any leading zeros.

This approach ensures that each digit is handled properly according to its place value.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Let's implement the solution in Python, breaking down each step:

```python
def multiply(num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
    if num1 == "0" or num2 == "0":
        return "0"
    
    # Initialize result array with zeros
    result = [0] * (len(num1) + len(num2))
    
    # Reverse strings to make it easier to handle place values
    num1, num2 = num1[::-1], num2[::-1]
    
    # Multiply each digit from num1 with each digit from num2
    for i in range(len(num1)):
        for j in range(len(num2)):
            result[i + j] += int(num1[i]) * int(num2[j])
            # Handle carry over to the next digit
            result[i + j + 1] += result[i + j] // 10
            result[i + j] %= 10
    
    # Remove leading zeros and convert list to string
    while result[-1] == 0:
        result.pop()
    result = result[::-1]  # Reverse back to original order
    
    return ''.join(map(str, result))
```

Step by step explanation:
- We check for the easy case. If either of the strings is "0", the product is also "0".
- We initialize an array of zeros with a length equal to `len(num1) + len(num2)` since it's the maximum possible length of the product.
- We reverse both strings to align their least significant digits (1's place) starting from the array's 0th index.
- We use nested loops to iterate over each digit of `num1` and `num2`, multiply them, and store the result in the `result` array, taking into account the indices which represent the place value.
- We handle carry over by adding the value at `result[i + j]` to the next position `(i + j + 1)`, and then use the modulus operator to keep only the single-digit in `result[i + j]`.
- After the multiplication, we remove any leading zeros that are not part of the actual number.
- We reverse the list back to its original number order.
- Finally, we join the integers in the `result` array into a string.

### Elaborate Examples:
Let's take num1="123" and num2="456" as an example. The multiplication operation would be similar to:

```
  1 2 3
x 4 5 6
-------
  7 3 8  (123 * 6)
6 1 5    (123 * 5, shifted one position to the left)
4 9 2 0  (123 * 4, shifted two positions to the left)
-------
5 6 0 8 8
```

After processing the carries, we arrive at the final result "56088".

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
Time complexity:
- There are two nested loops, each iterating at most 200 times since the maximum length of num1 and num2 is 200.
- This results in a time complexity of O(n * m), where n is the length of `num1` and m is the length of `num2`.

Space complexity:
- We are using a result array whose length is n + m, where n is the length of `num1` and m is the length of `num2`.
- Hence, the space complexity is O(n + m).

### Real-World Applications:
Simulating string multiplication as demonstrated in this problem can be highly useful in systems or programming languages that do not support large numbers natively. Applications that deal with cryptography, scientific computations, and financial calculations often require precise handling of very large numbers, making string-based arithmetic a useful approach.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- Forgetting to handle the carry might be one of the most common mistakes.
- Failing to remove the leading zeros could result in an incorrect representation of the number.
- Accidentally mutating the `result` array in incorrect indices might skew the final result.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem is a classic case of simulating arithmetical operations manually, a common pattern where you have to implement basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division from scratch.
