LeetCode Problem number 70 is titled "Climbing Stairs". This classic problem falls under the category of dynamic programming and can also be approached using Fibonacci sequence concepts. Now, let's break down the problem and discuss it in detail, examining various solution strategies and their implementations in Python.

### Problem Statement

You are climbing a staircase. It starts with you at the bottom, and you must reach the top. The staircase has `n` steps, and you can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time. Your task is to determine how many distinct ways you can climb to the top.

#### Inputs and Outputs:

- The input is a single integer `n` representing the total number of steps in the staircase.
- The output is an integer representing the number of distinct ways to climb to the top.

#### Constraints:

- Given `n` will be a positive integer, typically within a range that avoids integer overflow issues.

### Examples:

Example 1:
```
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

Example 2:
```
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

### Solution Strategy

There are various strategies to solve this problem. Let's discuss three common ones:

**1. Recursive (Brute Force):**
A simple way to solve this is using recursion by breaking down the problem into subproblems. For instance, to reach the nth step, you could either come from the (n-1)th step or the (n-2)th step. This suggests a recursive relationship. However, this approach often results in redundant calculations and a very high time complexity (exponential), making it impractical for larger values of `n`.

**2. Dynamic Programming:**
To optimize the recursive solution, we can use dynamic programming (DP). With DP, we store the results of subproblems in a table to avoid redundant calculations. The DP approach here closely resembles the Fibonacci sequence, where `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]` (similar to `fib(i) = fib(i-1) + fib(i-2)`). This approach has a linear time complexity.

**3. Fibonacci Sequence (Space-Optimized Dynamic Programming):**
We can notice that at any step, the number of ways to reach that step is only dependent on the previous two steps. So, instead of storing the entire DP table, we can just store the last two values, further optimizing the space complexity.

### Python Code Explanation

Let's implement the space-optimized dynamic programming approach:

```python
def climbStairs(n):
    a, b = 1, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```

Here's a line-by-line breakdown:

- `a, b = 1, 1`: Initialize two variables `a` and `b` both set to 1. `a` represents the number of ways to reach the current step, `b` represents the number of ways to reach the next step.

- `for i in range(n)`: Iterate `n` times.

- `a, b = b, a + b`: Update `a` to `b`, and `b` to `a + b`. This simulates moving up the staircase, using the Fibonacci-like sequence, where the new `b` is the sum of the ways to reach the current and previous steps.

- `return a`: After iterating `n` times, `a` will contain the number of ways to reach step `n`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: Since we loop through `n` steps once, the time complexity is O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: We use only two variables regardless of `n`, so the space complexity is O(1).

### Real-World Applications

The "Climbing Stairs" problem is a simplified model of many real-world scenarios involving permutations and combinations, such as:
- Pathfinding in grids or graphs, where you have limited options at each step.
- Resource allocation with constraints.
- Calculating probabilities in board games or puzzles where moves are limited.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Avoiding recursion for large `n` due to stack overflow and exponential time complexity.
- Recognizing the Fibonacci pattern can greatly simplify the solution.
- Remembering that dynamic programming can often be space-optimized if only a few previous states are necessary.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem is an excellent example of both dynamic programming and recognizing mathematical sequences (Fibonacci sequence) in algorithmic problems. Learning to identify such patterns can significantly reduce the complexity of problem-solving.
