LeetCode Problem #20 is titled "Valid Parentheses". This problem is a classic in computer science, often used to teach the concept of stacks. Here is a detailed analysis of the problem and how one might go about solving it in Python.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
The problem statement goes as such: given a string `s` containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

A string is considered valid if:
1. Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets are closed in the correct order.

It should be noted that an empty string is also considered valid.

There are a few nuances to consider in this problem:
- Matching pairs must be of the same type: '(' pairs with ')', '[' pairs with ']', and '{' pairs with '}'.
- Pairs must close in the appropriate order; for example, "([)]" is not valid because the brackets close out of order.
- It is not sufficient for there to be an equal number of open and closed brackets; they must be correctly paired.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
The most common and efficient way to solve this problem is to use a stack, which is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Here's how you can apply a stack to solve this problem:

1. Iterate over the input string.
2. Every time you encounter an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
3. When you encounter a closing bracket, it must match the bracket at the top of the stack; if it does, pop that bracket off.
4. If at any point you encounter a closing bracket that does not match the top of the stack, or if the stack is empty when you find a closing bracket, the string is invalid.
5. After the iteration, if the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket had a matching closing bracket in the correct order, and the string is valid. Otherwise, it's invalid.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
Here's how you might implement the above algorithm in Python:

```python
def isValid(s):
    stack = []
    mapping = {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}  # Mapping of closing to opening brackets.

    for char in s:
        if char in mapping:  # It's a closing bracket.
            top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'  # Use a dummy character if stack is empty.
            if mapping[char] != top_element:
                return False
        else:
            stack.append(char)  # It's an opening bracket.

    return not stack  # If stack is empty, all brackets were closed properly.
```

Here is the line-by-line breakdown:
- `stack = []` initializes the stack as an empty list.
- `mapping` is a dictionary that maps each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket.
- The `for` loop iterates through each character in the input string `s`.
- `if char in mapping:` checks if the character is one of the closing brackets.
- If it is a closing bracket, `top_element` is assigned the top of the stack if the stack is not empty; otherwise, we assign it a dummy character ('#'). This is to handle the edge case where the stack is empty when we find a closing bracket.
- `if mapping[char] != top_element:` checks if the top element on the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket of the current closing bracket, and if so, returns `False`.
- If the character is not in `mapping`, it's an opening bracket. In that case, we append it to the stack.
- At the end of the loop, the stack should be empty if all the brackets are properly closed and nested. Thus, `return not stack` will return `True` if the stack is empty and `False` if it's not.

### Elaborate Examples
Consider the following examples:
1. `s = "()"` is valid because parentheses are correctly closed.
2. `s = "()[]{}"` is valid because all types of brackets are closed in the correct order.
3. `s = "(]"` is invalid because a square bracket is incorrectly closing a parenthesis.
4. `s = "([)]"` is invalid because the order of the brackets is incorrect; a square bracket closes before a parenthesis does.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we traversed through each character in the string exactly once. The space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case (when all characters are opening brackets), as that would be the maximum size of the stack.

### Real-World Applications
This problem is a simplified model of various real-world scenarios such as:
- Syntax checking in programming languages where various types of parentheses must be balanced.
- Validating expressions in mathematical computations.
- Processing nested structures in data (e.g., XML or JSON parsing).

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks
Common pitfalls include:
- Forgetting to check if the stack is empty before popping (which could raise an exception).
- Not considering the case where the stack still contains elements after parsing the entire string.

A handy trick is to use a dictionary to map closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets, as it simplifies lookups.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem exemplifies the stack usage pattern where a stack is ideal for problems requiring elements to be processed in reverse order from which they are received.
