LeetCode Problem #84 is titled "Largest Rectangle in Histogram". This problem falls under the category of stack data structures and algorithms. Let me provide you with an extensive breakdown of the problem and its solution.

### Problem Statement

Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

### Understanding the Problem

A histogram is a graphical representation of data where each bar's height represents some quantity, and all bars are placed adjacent to each other with no space in between. In this problem, each bar has a width of 1, and we need to find the maximal rectangular area that can be formed within the bounds of the histogram bars.

Here are some nuanced points to consider:

- The height of the histogram bars is given by an array of non-negative integers.
- The width of each bar is uniform and is given as 1 unit.
- A rectangle's area is calculated as its height multiplied by its width. In the context of the histogram, the height of the rectangle is determined by the shortest bar within the desired range (since the rectangle cannot exceed this height), and the width is determined by how many consecutive bars you can include in the rectangle.
- We are looking for the largest such possible rectangle area, not just any rectangle.

### Solution Strategy

There are several approaches to solving this problem, such as the brute force method, divide and conquer, and using a stack. For the purposes of this explanation, I will focus on the stack-based approach because it provides an efficient solution.

The main idea behind this solution is to maintain a stack that stores indices of the bars. The stack is used to find the next smaller bar of every bar in the histogram which gives the bounds of the rectangle with the histogram bar as height.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate through each bar in the histogram.
3. While the stack is not empty and the current bar height is less than the height of the bar at the index at the top of the stack, it means we've found a smaller bar, and we can calculate the area:
    - Pop the top of the stack (this index represents the height of the rectangle to compute).
    - Calculate the area using the popped height and the width determined by the current index and the new top of the stack after popping (i.e., distance between the current index and the bar left in the stack).
    - Update the answer with the maximum area obtained so far.
4. Push the current index to the stack.
5. After the iteration, process the remaining indices in the stack (which will have bars of ascending height) using the same area calculation method.
6. The final answer is the maximum area calculated during the process.

### Example

Let's illustrate the approach with a small example:

```
Heights array: [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3]
```

- We start with an empty stack.
- As we iterate, we push indices 0, 1 into the stack.
- At index 2, since 5 > 1, we push index 2 into the stack.
- At index 3, since 6 > 5, push index 3 into the stack.
- At index 4, since 2 < 6, we pop the top of the stack (index 3) and calculate the area with height 6 and width (4 - 2) = 2 units. Hence area = 12, which we record if it's the largest so far.
- Continue popping from the stack and calculating areas as long as the stack top is greater than the current height. So we calculate the area with height 5 and width (4 - 1) = 3 units, hence area = 15.
- We now push index 4 to the stack, since it has no smaller to its left anymore, and repeat the process for index 5.

### Python Code Explanation

The Python code will follow the stack-based approach described above. We will perform a detailed analysis of the code after implementing it.

### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the stack-based solution is O(n), where n is the number of bars in the histogram. This is because each bar is pushed to and popped from the stack exactly once. The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case, when all bars are pushed to the stack (e.g., when the input array is sorted in ascending order).

Now let's implement the stack-based solution in Python and then discuss the code in detail.
