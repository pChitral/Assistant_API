LeetCode Problem 51 is titled "N-Queens". This is a classic backtracking problem in which you are asked to find all distinct solutions to the N-Queens puzzle. The N-Queens puzzle is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NxN chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. That means no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
Here are some aspects of the problem:
- Given an integer N, representing the number of queens (which is also the size of the chessboard), you need to return all possible board configurations where the N queens do not attack each other.
- The output should be a list of lists. Each list represents one solution, and it contains strings with '.' (dots) representing an empty space on the board and 'Q' representing a queen.
- The order in which these solutions are returned does not matter.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
To approach this problem, we will use backtracking, a form of recursion where we explore all possible configurations and "backtrack" once we determine that the current path cannot lead to a solution.

Here's how we can go about implementing this:
1. **Select Column**: Start in the first row and try placing a queen in each column one by one.
2. **Validate**: After placing the queen, we need to check if the current placement leads to any conflict (if they attack each other). Queens attack if they are on the same row, same column, or the same diagonal.
3. **Recurse or Backtrack**: If no conflict occurs, we move to the next row and try to place another queen. If a conflict is detected, we remove the queen (backtrack) and try the next position in the row.
4. **Find All Solutions**: Continue this process until all rows are filled without conflicts, indicating a solution. We then add this configuration to our results list and backtrack to find other possible configurations.
5. **Convert to Required Output**: Once we have a working solution, we convert the placement representation into the required string format and add it to our result set.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Below is a detailed Python solution for the N-Queens problem. The code will be broken down afterward.

```python
def solveNQueens(n):
    def createBoard(state):
        board = []
        for i in state:
            row = '.' * i + 'Q' + '.' * (n - i - 1)
            board.append(row)
        return board
    
    def backtrack(row, diagonals, anti_diagonals, cols, state):
        if row == n:
            board = createBoard(state)
            solutions.append(board)
            return
        for col in range(n):
            curr_diag = row - col
            curr_anti_diag = row + col
            if col in cols or curr_diag in diagonals or curr_anti_diag in anti_diagonals:
                continue
            cols.add(col)
            diagonals.add(curr_diag)
            anti_diagonals.add(curr_anti_diag)
            state.append(col)
            
            backtrack(row + 1, diagonals, anti_diagonals, cols, state)
            
            cols.remove(col)
            diagonals.remove(curr_diag)
            anti_diagonals.remove(curr_anti_diag)
            state.pop()
    
    solutions = []
    backtrack(0, set(), set(), set(), [])
    return solutions
```

Here's what each part does:

- `solveNQueens(n)`: This is the main function which will be invoked with `n`, the size of the board and the number of queens.

- `createBoard(state)`: A helper function that takes the list `state`, which is a list indicating the column positions of queens in each row, and returns a list of strings representing the board configuration.

- `backtrack(row, diagonals, anti_diagonals, cols, state)`: This is a recursive helper function that attempts to place a queen in each column of the current row. It uses the parameters `diagonals`, `anti_diagonals`, and `cols` to keep track of which diagonals, anti-diagonals, and columns are already occupied by queens, thus ensuring that no two queens can attack each other. The `state` keeps track of the column positions of queens.

- `solutions`: A list to store the final board configurations that satisfy the N-Queens conditions.

The solution involves checking the column (`col`), diagonal (`curr_diag`), and anti-diagonal (`curr_anti_diag`) to determine if placing a queen will lead to a conflict. If placing a queen is valid, we add the current column to `cols`, `diagonals`, and `anti_diagonals` to block these lines from future queen placements, and we add the column index to `state`.

### Elaborate Examples:
For `n=4`, the solution will be:
```
[
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
```
These are the two possible solutions for 4 queens on a 4x4 board.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: The algorithm's time complexity is *O(N!)*. This comes from the idea that we have N options in the first row, N-1 in the second, and so on. Since backtracking ensures that we only explore valid possibilities, we don't actually evaluate all *N^N* options.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is *O(N)*. This arises from storing the current state (which takes *O(N)* space), and the recursive call stack for placing queens, which can go up to *N* levels deep in the worst case.

### Real-World Applications:
The N-Queens problem is a prototypical example for constraint satisfaction problems, which have applications in areas such as scheduling, planning, designing, and optimizing systems where a set of objects must satisfy a number of constraints or limitations.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- Remember to check both diagonals for each queen's position.
- Use sets to quickly check for conflicts (constant time operation).
 
### Problem Pattern Identification:
The N-Queens problem is an example of the backtracking algorithmic pattern. Backtracking is used in combinatorial problems where you need to find all (or some) feasible solutions and involves exploring each possibility and abandoning it ("backtracking") if it does not lead to a solution.
