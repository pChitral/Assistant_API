LeetCode Problem 51 corresponds to the "N-Queens" problem. Here is an extensive breakdown and solution for this well-known backtracking challenge.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
The N-Queens puzzle is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics. The challenge is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, there can be no two queens sharing the same row, column, or diagonal.

Subtleties of the problem statement include:
- The size of the board (N) is a parameter that can vary, and the solution should work for any positive integer value of N.
- The expected output is a list of solutions, with each solution representing one distinct configuration of the N queens on the board.
- Each solution within the list is represented as a list of strings, where each string represents a row of the chessboard.
   - If there's a queen on the row, the corresponding character in the string is 'Q'.
   - If the row is empty at that column, the corresponding character is '.' (a dot).

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
A popular approach to solving the N-Queens puzzle is backtracking. The backtracking algorithm explores all possible board configurations and "backtracks" when it identifies that a configuration cannot possibly lead to a successful solution.

Here are the key steps in solving N-Queens with the backtracking approach:

1. **Initialization**: Start with an empty board, represented by a matrix or a list of strings where each element is a row initialized with dots.

2. **Recursive Exploration**: Place a queen on the board, then proceed to the next row.

3. **Constraints Check**: After placing each queen, check for collisions with other queens on the board. This includes checks for the same row, column, and both diagonals.

4. **Backtracking**: If placing a queen leads to a conflict, backtrack by removing the queen and trying the next position in the row.

5. **Solution Accumulation**: Once a valid configuration for all N queens is found, store the board configuration as a solution.

6. **Resume Exploration**: After finding a valid configuration (or when backtracking), continue exploring for other possible solutions.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
Here is a Python function that implements the backtracking approach:

```python
def solveNQueens(n):
    def create_board(state):
        board = []
        for row in state:
            board.append(''.join(row))
        return board
    
    def is_valid(state, row, col):
        for i in range(row):
            if state[i][col] == 'Q':
                return False
            if (0 <= col - (row - i) < n) and state[i][col - (row - i)] == 'Q':
                return False
            if (0 <= col + (row - i) < n) and state[i][col + (row - i)] == 'Q':
                return False
        return True
    
    def backtrack(state, row):
        if row == n:
            solutions.append(create_board(state))
            return
        for col in range(n):
            if is_valid(state, row, col):
                state[row][col] = 'Q'
                backtrack(state, row + 1)
                state[row][col] = '.'
    
    solutions = []
    empty_row = ['.'] * n
    state = [empty_row[:] for _ in range(n)]
    backtrack(state, 0)
    return solutions
```

- `solveNQueens(n)`: Starts the process by creating an initial board and calling the `backtrack` function.
- `create_board(state)`: Converts the internal state representation (a list of lists) into the required output format (a list of strings).

- `is_valid(state, row, col)`: Checks if placing a queen at the given `row` and `col` is valid. This function checks for conflicts vertically in the same column and diagonally in both directions.

- `backtrack(state, row)`: The recursive backtracking function that attempts to place a queen in each column of the current row, then calls itself to proceed to the next row. If the board state results in a valid configuration where all `N` queens are placed without conflicts, it adds the board to `solutions`.

- `state`: Keeps track of the current board configuration using a 2D array of strings, with each element being either a `'Q'` for a queen or `'.'` for an empty square.

- `solutions`: Accumulates all valid board configurations.

### Elaborate Examples
Let's walk through an example for `n = 4`. When `solveNQueens(4)` is called, we explore placing queens row by row:

1. Place the first queen at `(0, 0)`.
2. Move to the next row and try placing the second queen. The first valid position is `(1, 2)`.
3. Move to the third row. There's no valid column in this row where a queen can be placed without being attacked, so we backtrack.
4. Move the queen in the second row to the next valid position `(1, 3)`.
5. Continue this process to try all other positions. And when we reach `row == n`, we have a solution.

Finally, we would get two solutions:

```
[
 [".Q..",
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
```

### Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this solution is `O(N!)` since there are N possible ways to place the first queen, N-1 to place the second, and so on. The recursive calls generate a tree of calls, each decreasing the number of calls by one possible placement, leading to factorial time complexity.

The space complexity is `O(N)` due to the board state and the recursion stack, which at most will contain N calls deep due to the placement of one queen per row.

### Real-World Applications
- The N-Queens problem is a foundation for understanding constraints satisfaction problems which are prevalent in scheduling, assignment, and planning tasks.
- It's used in algorithm courses to teach recursion, backtracking, and problem-solving heuristics.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks
- Forgetting to create additional board configurations for the solutions (deep copies) may result in all collected solutions being references to the same board.
- A subtle error can be made if diagonals are not checked properly. Remember that there are two diagonals to consider from any given cell.
- One optimization trick is to use additional data structures to track which columns, diagonals, and anti-diagonals are under attack, which can reduce the constant time overhead of the `is_valid` checks.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem is a fundamental example of a backtracking algorithm, wherein you incrementally build up candidates to the solution and abandon a candidate as soon as it determines that this candidate cannot possibly lead to a final solution.
