LeetCode Problem 105 is titled "Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal". Let's go through the problem statement, and then I will break it down in detail before we move on to the solution.

Problem Statement:
Given two integer arrays `preorder` and `inorder` where `preorder` is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and `inorder` is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.

Understanding the Problem:
To understand this problem, you should be familiar with the concept of tree traversal. In a binary tree, each node contains a value, and up to two children (left and right). The preorder traversal of a binary tree is a depth-first traversal where the current node is processed before the left and right children. The inorder traversal processes the left child, then the current node, and finally the right child.

In this problem, you're given two lists:
- `preorder`: A list of integers representing the order in which nodes are visited in a preorder traversal of the tree.
- `inorder`: A list of integers representing the order in which nodes are visited in an inorder traversal of the same tree.

Your task is to use these two lists to reconstruct the original binary tree. The binary tree is guaranteed to have unique values for nodes, meaning there will be no duplicates, which assures a single unique solution to the problem.

Here are the nuances in the problem:
1. Both `preorder` and `inorder` arrays are of the same length.
2. Every value in the `preorder` array is unique.
3. Every value in the `inorder` array is unique.
4. The `preorder` and `inorder` arrays represent the traversal order of the same binary tree.

Solution Strategy:
To solve this problem, one should be acquainted with how the preorder and inorder traversal orders relate to the tree structure. Specifically, remember these key facts:
- The first element in the `preorder` list is the root of the binary tree.
- The `inorder` list contains the left subtree's nodes before the root's value and the right subtree's nodes after the root's value.

Using these facts, we can design a recursive algorithm to construct the binary tree:

1. Pop the first value from the `preorder` list; this is the root node.
2. Find this root node's value in the `inorder` list. The nodes to its left in the `inorder` list make up the left subtree, and the nodes to its right make up the right subtree.
3. Recur for the left subtree with the corresponding `inorder` subrange.
4. Recur for the right subtree with the corresponding `inorder` subrange.
5. Stop recursion when no elements are left for the subtree in the `inorder` subrange.

One potential optimization is to use a hashmap to store the indices of the elements in the `inorder` list, so we can quickly find the root in the `inorder` array without the need to search through it each time.

We will implement this strategy and analyze its time and space complexity after we discuss the code in detail.

Complexity Analysis:
When we work through the solution, we will analyze the time complexity, which is often O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, because we visit each node exactly once. The space complexity is also O(n) to account for the space used in the recursion stack and the hashmap that we may use for node lookups.

Now let's proceed to code the solution and analyze it in detail.
