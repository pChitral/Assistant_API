Problem Number,Output
1,"LeetCode Problem #1 is titled ""Two Sum.""

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The problem statement is simple yet forms the basis of many coding challenges. You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer target `target`. You need to find two numbers in the array that add up to the target number. The function should return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where the index1 must be less than index2. Note that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Subtleties that might affect the solution include:
- There is exactly one solution - no need to consider multiple solutions scenarios.
- You can't use the same element twice - this prevents a simple looping to add each number with itself.
- The order of indices matters. The first index should be smaller than the second.
- The array is not guaranteed to be sorted which rules out certain algorithms that require sorted arrays.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
To solve the ""Two Sum"" problem, there are several approaches one can take:

1. **Brute Force Approach**: Check all possible pairs of numbers until you find the pair that satisfies the condition. This approach takes O(n^2) time because for each element, we try to find its complement by looping through the rest of the array.

2. **Two-Pass Hash Table**: Use a hash table to reduce the average lookup time to O(1). In the first iteration, we insert each element's value and its index into the table. Then, in the second iteration, we check if each element's complement (`target - nums[i]`) exists in the hash table. If it does and the complement is not the number itself, we have found the solution. This approach takes O(n) time because we traverse the list containing n elements exactly twice. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the extra hash table.

3. **One-Pass Hash Table**: It's an optimization over the two-pass approach. As we iterate and insert elements into the table, we also look back to check if the current element's complement already exists in the table. This way we can reduce the time complexity to O(n) while maintaining the same space complexity.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    hashmap = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in hashmap:
            return [hashmap[complement], i]
        hashmap[num] = i
```

- `hashmap = {}`: We use a Python dictionary to create a hash map for storing the array elements and their indices for constant-time look-ups.
- `for i, num in enumerate(nums)`: We iterate through the `nums` list with both the index (`i`) and the value (`num`).
- `complement = target - num`: For each value, we compute what value would complement it to sum up to the target.
- `if complement in hashmap`: We check whether this complement has already been observed in the array - but earlier in the iteration - and stored in the hash map.
- `return [hashmap[complement], i]`: If the complement exists, we return a list containing the indices of the complement value and the current number.
- `hashmap[num] = i`: If no complement was found, we store the current number along with its index in the hash map for future reference.

### Elaborate Examples:
Let's run a couple of examples to illustrate this:

Example 1:
```python
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
# The function should return [0, 1] because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9
```

Example 2:
```python
nums = [3, 2, 4]
target = 6
# The function should return [1, 2] because nums[1] + nums[2] == 6
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity of the one-pass hash table solution is O(n) because it goes through the list of numbers exactly once. Each look-up in the hash table costs only O(1) time on average.

The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because the worst case entails inserting all elements into the hash table, requiring space proportional to the number of elements.

### Real-World Applications:
The ""Two Sum"" problem is a foundational problem in coding interviews and is often used to test basic understanding of hash tables and arrays. In real-world scenarios, you might encounter similar problems when dealing with financial transactions, like identifying pairs of transactions that add up to a certain amount, or in data analytics, where finding pairs with certain relationships is crucial.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- Forgetting that array indices start at 0 in Python can lead to off-by-one errors.
- Failing to consider that the hash table might already contain the same number for which you're trying to find a complement (you're not allowed to use the same element twice).
- Not handling the case where multiple pairs could give the same sum, even though the problem specifies there would be only one valid solution.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
Recognizing the use of hash tables to achieve efficient look-ups is a common pattern in solving array and string problems, especially when dealing with pairings or complement problems.

The hash table-based approach and the insights gained from understanding two-sum variants are broadly applicable across these related problems."
2,"LeetCode Problem #2 is titled ""Add Two Numbers"" and is a medium difficulty level problem. Let's break down the problem statement and then explore the solution in depth.

### Problem Statement:

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Input:** (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
**Output:** 7 -> 0 -> 8
**Explanation:** 342 + 465 = 807.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

- The numbers are represented by linked lists where each node contains a single digit of the number.
- The least significant digit is at the head of the list (i.e., the numbers are stored in reverse order).
- A new linked list should be returned that represents the sum of the two numbers.
- The problem not only tests your ability to work with linked lists but also your capacity to handle elementary arithmetic and logical problems in a coding environment.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

The straightforward way to solve the ""Add Two Numbers"" problem is to simulate the addition process that you would perform by hand. You start by adding the least significant digits, which are the first nodes of each list. 

You'll keep track of a ""carry"" value so that if the sum of two digits exceeds 9, it carries over to the next set of nodes. You'll create new nodes for the summed value and chain it to the resulting linked list. You'll continue moving along both linked lists until you reach the end of both while considering the ""carry"" value if it's non-zero.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

To implement our solution, we'll first define the ListNode class, which is the building block of our linked lists (this is typically provided by LeetCode in the problem description). Then, we'll write the function to add the numbers.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # Initialize current node to dummy head of the returning list.
        dummy_head = ListNode(0)
        current = dummy_head
        
        carry = 0
        # Loop through lists l1 and l2 until you reach both ends.
        while l1 is not None or l2 is not None:
            # At the start of each iteration, we should add carry from last iteration.
            total_sum = carry
            if l1 is not None:
                total_sum += l1.val
                l1 = l1.next
            if l2 is not None:
                total_sum += l2.val
                l2 = l2.next
                
            # Update carry for next iteration.
            carry = total_sum // 10
            # Create a new node with the digit value of (sum mod 10).
            current.next = ListNode(total_sum % 10)
            # Move to the next position.
            current = current.next

        # After processing both lists, if there is a carry left, add a new node.
        if carry > 0:
            current.next = ListNode(carry)
        
        # The first node is a dummy node, so we return the next node.
        return dummy_head.next
```

- We initialize a dummy head for the result linked list to make the list construction cleaner since we can avoid handling an empty list as a special case.
- We maintain a variable `carry` to keep track of the carry-over during the addition.
- In each iteration of the while loop, we sum the current values of `l1` and `l2`, along with the carry.
- The `total_sum // 10` gives us the new carry, and `total_sum % 10` gives us the digit to put in the new node.
- After processing both lists, if there is a carry left (i.e., the final sum is greater than 9), we add one last node with the carry value.
- We return `dummy_head.next` because `dummy_head` was a placeholder and does not contain a digit that belongs to the sum.

### Elaborate Examples:

Consider adding the numbers represented by the linked lists (2 -> 4 -> 3) and (5 -> 6 -> 4):

- Initially, `carry` is 0. The sum of (2 + 5 + carry) is 7, which is less than 10, so no carry.
- Next, we add 4 and 6. The sum is 10, we store 0 and carry over 1 to the next digits.
- Then we add 3, 4, and the carry 1, which is 8.
- The final linked list is 7 -> 0 -> 8.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

- Time complexity: O(max(N, M)), where N and M are the lengths of l1 and l2 respectively. Each node in both linked lists is traversed exactly once.
- Space complexity: O(max(N, M)). The length of the new list is at most max(N,M) + 1.

### Real-World Applications:

This problem has applications in numerical computation tasks that involve large numbers that cannot be stored in a regular variable due to the size or precision requirements.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Do not forget to move the list pointers forward after processing each node.
- Remember to handle carry at the end of the addition when one list is longer than the other, or both lists have been completely traversed.
- It's easy to forget about the dummy head and accidentally return the dummy node instead of `dummy_head.next`.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem uses a two-pointer approach to simultaneously traverse two data structures, performing operations on corresponding elements.

3,"LeetCode problem number 3 is titled ""Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters."" The problem statement is as follows:

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = ""abcabcbb""
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is ""abc"", with the length of 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = ""bbbbb""
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is ""b"", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = ""pwwkew""
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is ""wke"", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, ""pwke"" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

In this problem, a substring is defined as a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. The goal is to find the longest such sequence that contains no repeating characters. It's crucial to note that substrings are different from subsequences in that they must be continuous; characters cannot be skipped over.

Subtleties in the problem statement include understanding the definition of a repeating character—any character that appears more than once in the substring—and the requirement that the characters within the substring must be unique.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The naive approach to this problem would involve generating all possible substrings and checking each one for uniqueness, which would lead to an O(n^2) or O(n^3) time complexity solution, rendering it inefficient for large strings.

A more efficient approach is the sliding window technique. This technique uses two pointers to create a window that can be expanded and contracted. Here's how you can use it:

1. Initialize two pointers, start and end, keeping track of the current window's boundaries.
2. Use a set or a hash map to track the characters in the current window.
3. Expand the end pointer to the right and add characters to the set until a repeat character is found.
4. When a repeat character is encountered, record the current window's length if it is the longest so far.
5. Move the start pointer to the right to shrink the window, removing characters from the set until the repeat character is removed.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the end pointer has gone through the entire string.

The sliding window approach ensures that we only examine each character in the string once, leading to an O(n) time complexity.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's implement the sliding window algorithm in Python:

```python
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: str) -> int:
    char_set = set()  # This will store unique characters of the current window
    max_length = 0  # The maximum length of the substring without repeating characters
    start = 0  # The starting index of the current window

    for end in range(len(s)):
        # If the character is already in the set, we remove the earliest character in the set until it's gone
        while s[end] in char_set:
            char_set.remove(s[start])
            start += 1
        # Add the character to the set and update the max_length if possible
        char_set.add(s[end])
        max_length = max(max_length, end - start + 1)

    return max_length
```

### Elaborate Examples

Let's apply the solution to Example 3 ""pwwkew"":

1. Initialize empty character set, `max_length = 0`, `start = 0`.
2. `end = 0`, character 'p', add 'p' to set: `char_set = {'p'}`, `max_length = 1`.
3. `end = 1`, character 'w', add 'w' to set: `char_set = {'p', 'w'}`, `max_length = 2`.
4. `end = 2`, character 'w', already in set. We remove from start until 'w' is no longer in the set:

   - Remove 'p', `start = 1`, `char_set = {'w'}`
   - Since we are looking at 'w' and it's already in set, no need to remove more. Add 'w' (second one): `char_set = {'w', 'w'}` (In reality, it's still a set, so the 'w' is not duplicated)

5. `end = 3`, character 'k', add 'k' to set: `char_set = {'w', 'k'}`, `max_length = 3`.
6. `end = 4`, character 'e', add 'e' to set: `char_set = {'w', 'k', 'e'}`, `max_length = 3`.
7. `end = 5`, character 'w' is in set, remove from start until 'w' is not in set:

   - Remove 'w', `start = 2`, `char_set = {'k', 'e'}`
   - Now 'w' is not in set anymore, add 'w': `char_set = {'k', 'e', 'w'}`, `max_length = 3`.

The loop ends and the longest substring without repeat characters is ""wke"" with length 3.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. Each character is looked at exactly twice: once when expanding the end pointer and once when moving the start pointer. The space complexity is O(min(n, m)), where m is the size of the character set used in the string (in the ASCII case it is constant 128, for Unicode it could be larger). This is due to the additional set used to store the characters, which in the worst case, stores all unique characters in the string.

### Real-World Applications

This problem represents a common task in text processing and parsing, where it might be necessary to find a unique sequence of characters or tokens. For example, in tokenizing for a compiler, ensuring a variable name is not duplicated within the same scope could be similar to this problem.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

One common pitfall is forgetting to update the `max_length` after each iteration, or incorrectly updating it inside the inner while loop, which could cause an incorrect result if a character is added to the `char_set` without checking the length of the current substring.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The sliding window pattern is crucial for solving problems where you're asked to find continuous substrings or subarrays that meet certain criteria. Recognizing this as a sliding-window problem is key to devising an efficient solution.

4,"LeetCode Problem #4 is titled ""Median of Two Sorted Arrays"". The problem statement is as follows:

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

This is a classical problem in statistics and computer science, which requires finding the middle value or the value that separates the higher half from the lower half of the combined dataset of two sorted arrays. The main challenges of this problem include:

- The arrays are separately sorted, and direct concatenation would disrupt their order.
- You're required to find an efficient solution that has a logarithmic time complexity, which means a simple merge followed by a sort won't suffice due to its linear time complexity.
- Since it's about medians, even number of elements (where average of middle two values is taken) and odd number of elements (where the middle value is the median) need to be handled differently.
- Calculating the median without actually merging the arrays to enforce the required time complexity constraint.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

The optimal approach for this problem is to use a binary search algorithm. This works by finding a partition between the arrays such that:

1. The left half has as many elements as the right half or only one more if the combined number of elements in both arrays is odd.
2. Every element on the left side of the partition is less than or equal to every element on the right side.

To do this, we will perform a binary search on the smaller array to minimize the iterations. We'll try to partition the arrays in such a way that the inferred median based on the partitioning is the true median of the merged array without actually merging them.

1. Let's define `left_partition_max` as the maximum element on the left side of the partition and `right_partition_min` as the minimum element on the right side.
2. We want to find a partition where `left_partition_max <= right_partition_min`.
3. The binary search will continue adjusting the partition until this condition is met.

The arrays are indexed from 0 to m-1 for `nums1` and 0 to n-1 for `nums2`. We'll call the partitions `i` and `j` for `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively.

Here is how the algorithm functions:
- We start with two pointers `min_index` and `max_index`, which define the range for the binary search, initialized at 0 and `m` (the size of the smaller array), respectively.
- We calculate `i` as the midpoint between `min_index` and `max_index`.
- Based on `i`, we calculate `j` as `(m + n + 1) / 2 - i`.
- We compare the values around `i` and `j` to find the correct partition. Specifically, we check if `nums1[i-1] <= nums2[j]` and `nums2[j-1] <= nums1[i]`.
- If the partitions are not in a correct position, we adjust the search range based on the comparison results and continue the binary search.

Once the correct partition is found, the median is calculated as follows:
- If `m + n` is odd, the median is `max(nums1[i-1], nums2[j-1])`.
- If `m + n` is even, the median is the average of `max(nums1[i-1], nums2[j-1])` and `min(nums1[i], nums2[j])`.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's implement the solution in Python and go through the code snippet by snippet.

```python
def findMedianSortedArrays(nums1, nums2):
    # Ensure nums1 is the smaller array to optimize the binary search range
    if len(nums1) > len(nums2):
        nums1, nums2 = nums2, nums1
    m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2)

    # Initialize the search range
    min_index, max_index, half_len = 0, m, (m + n + 1) // 2

    while min_index <= max_index:
        i = (min_index + max_index) // 2
        j = half_len - i

        # Check and adjust the binary search range based on partitioning
        if i < m and nums2[j-1] > nums1[i]:
            min_index = i + 1
        elif i > 0 and nums1[i-1] > nums2[j]:
            max_index = i - 1
        else:
            # Correct partitioning is found, determine the median
            if i == 0: left_max = nums2[j-1]
            else if j == 0: left_max = nums1[i-1]
            else: left_max = max(nums1[i-1], nums2[j-1])

            if (m + n) % 2 == 1:
                return left_max

            if i == m: right_min = nums2[j]
            else if j == n: right_min = nums1[i]
            else: right_min = min(nums1[i], nums2[j])

            return (left_max + right_min) / 2.0
```

Let's break down the above implementation:

1. First, we ensure that `nums1` is the smaller array. This is because the binary search will be performed on this array, and working with the smaller array minimizes the number of iterations.
2. We initialize `min_index` and `max_index` to `0` and `m`, which are the start and end indices for `nums1`. `half_len` is the sum of the lengths of both arrays divided by 2, which helps us figure out the midpoint for the combined arrays.
3. The `while` loop is the main binary search. It iterates until we finish checking all potential partitions (`min_index` > `max_index`).
4. Inside the loop, `i` is the midpoint of `nums1`, and `j` is derived from `i` to ensure that both sides of the partitions have equal numbers or the left side has one more element if the combined array has an odd total number of elements.
5. The `if` and `elif` statements inside the loop check the correctness of the partitioning by comparing elements just before and after the partition points `i` and `j`. If `nums1[i]` is smaller than `nums2[j-1]`, it means `i` is too small and we need to move `min_index` to the right. Conversely, if `nums1[i-1]` is greater than `nums2[j]`, `i` is too big, and we move `max_index` to the left.
6. When the correct partition is found, we calculate `left_max`. If `i` is `0`, it means all elements from `nums1` are on the right side of the partition, so we take the last element of the left partition from `nums2` as `left_max`. Likewise for `j` being `0`. If neither is `0`, we take the larger of the last elements from the two partitions.
7. If the combined array is odd in length (`(m + n) % 2 == 1`), we return `left_max` as the median.
8. For an even length, we also calculate `right_min` which is either the smallest element after the partition point or the first element of the array not contributing to `left_max`, if the partition point is the end of an array. We finally return the average of `left_max` and `right_min` as the median.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's elaborate with some examples. We will consider both odd and even combined lengths:

Example 1: nums1 = [1, 3], nums2 = [2]

- The merged array is [1, 2, 3], and the median is 2.

Example 2: nums1 = [1, 2], nums2 = [3, 4]

- The merged array is [1, 2, 3, 4], and the median is the average of 2 and 3, which is 2.5.

Example 3: nums1 = [1, 3, 5], nums2 = [2, 4, 6]

- In this example, the combined length is even (6), and the median will be the average of the third and fourth elements of the merged array, which are 3 and 4. Thus, the median is 3.5.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: The binary search runs in O(log(min(m, n))) time because we only run the binary search on the smaller of the two arrays. Each step of the binary search reduces the size of the problem by half.
- Space Complexity: O(1) - no additional space is required, as we are not merging the arrays and are only using a few extra variables for our calculations.

### Real-World Applications:

This kind of algorithm is extremely useful in statistics and data analysis, for instance, in calculating the median income of populations or median response time in A/B testing scenarios. Situations where an efficient calculation of a median is required for large datasets would benefit from this kind of optimized algorithm.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

A common pitfall would be to mistakenly sort or merge the arrays first, which would cost extra time and space complexity. A subtlety lies in the careful treatment of edge cases, such as when a partition index falls outside the bounds of an array.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem exemplifies the application of binary search beyond simply finding an element in a sorted sequence. It demonstrates how binary search can be adapted to problem solve various scenarios where we need to narrow down a solution efficiently.

### Links to Similar Problems:

Here's a list of problems that also involve binary search or are related to find the kth element in two sorted arrays:

- Search in Rotated Sorted Array (Problem #33)
- Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums (Problem #373)
- Find K-th Smallest Pair Distance (Problem #719)
- Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix (Problem #378)

Each of these problems applies binary search with different angles on sorted arrays or matrices, and practicing them can strengthen your understanding of this versatile algorithm."
5,"LeetCode Problem #5 is titled ""Longest Palindromic Substring"". The challenge is to find the longest palindromic substring within a given string `s`. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forwards, and a substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The key aspects of the problem are:

1. **Input:** A string `s` which consists of only printable ASCII characters.
2. **Output:** A string representing the longest palindromic substring of `s`.
3. **Constraints:**
   - The length of `s` is at least 1 and at most 1000.

Some nuances that may affect the solution include handling strings with:

- No repeating characters, where the longest palindromic substring is any single character.
- Multiple palindromic substrings of the same maximum length, where any of them could be a valid answer.
- Palindromic substrings that are nested within longer palindromic substrings.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

We can consider several strategies to solve this problem:

#### Brute Force Approach:
Iterate over all possible substrings of `s` and check if they are palindromic. Keep track of the longest one found so far. However, this approach is highly inefficient as it has a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the length of the string `s`.

#### Dynamic Programming Approach:
We can use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will indicate whether the substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome. To fill this table, we utilize the relationships between substrings: a string is a palindrome if the first and last characters are the same, and the substring enclosed by them is also a palindrome. This approach brings the complexity down to O(n^2) in both time and space.

#### Expand Around Center Approach:
The idea here is to consider every index in the string `s` as a potential center of a palindrome. Since palindromes have a symmetrical structure, we can expand around every center and check for palindromic strings. There can be 2n-1 such centers (considering every character and the gap between every pair of characters as potential centers), and for each center, expansion takes O(n) time, leading to a total time complexity of O(n^2). However, this approach requires only O(1) additional space.

#### Manacher's Algorithm:
This is a sophisticated algorithm that allows finding the longest palindromic substring in linear time O(n). It is a complex technique that involves transforming the input string into a new format (with separators inserted in between characters) and then using a clever algorithm to avoid unnecessary recomputation when checking for palindromes.

The Expand Around Center Approach is often preferred due to its simplicity and satisfactory performance in most cases. It offers a good trade-off with O(n^2) time and O(1) space complexity without the complexity of implementing Manacher's Algorithm.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's detail the Expand Around Center Approach:

```python
def longestPalindrome(s: str) -> str:
    def expand_around_center(left: int, right: int) -> str:
        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
            left -= 1
            right += 1
        return s[left + 1:right]

    longest = """"
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Odd length palindromes.
        palindrome1 = expand_around_center(i, i)
        # Even length palindromes.
        palindrome2 = expand_around_center(i, i + 1)

        # Update the longest palindrome found.
        longest = max(longest, palindrome1, palindrome2, key=len)

    return longest
```

The `longestPalindrome` function iterates over each index in the string `s`, treating it as the center of a potential palindrome. It then calls the helper function `expand_around_center` twice for each center - once considering palindromes of odd lengths with a single character at the center, and once for even lengths with a gap (potential pair of characters) at the center.

The helper function `expand_around_center` uses two pointers (left and right) and expands outwards while the characters at the left and right indices are equal, and the indices are within the bounds of the string. When the condition is not met anymore, it returns the palindromic substring found.

For every center, the function checks and updates the variable `longest` with the longest of the palindromic substrings found so far.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's run the code with a few examples:

Example 1: For the string `s = ""babad""`, the longest palindromic substrings are ""bab"" or ""aba"". The function can return either.

Example 2: For the string `s = ""cbbd""`, the longest palindromic substring is ""bb"".

Example 3: For the string `s = ""a""`, the longest palindromic substring is ""a"".

Example 4: For the string `s = ""ac""`, the longest palindromic substring can be either ""a"" or ""c"".

Example 5: For the string `s = ""racecar""`, the longest palindromic substring is ""racecar"".

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

The `longestPalindrome` function's time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we must iterate over each character and the gaps between characters, leading to 2n-1 centers, and for each center, we can expand in O(n) time in the worst case.

The space complexity of the `longestPalindrome` function is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of additional space apart from the input string `s`.

### Real-World Applications:

The problem of finding a palindromic substring could be applied in bioinformatics, where searching for palindromic sequences in DNA can be important for identifying certain genetic features or structures such as restriction enzyme sites.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Failing to consider that there can be both odd and even length palindromes: The code must check for both upon every iteration.
- Forgetting to update the longest palindrome found so far: Care must be taken to check each potential palindrome against the current longest and update accordingly.
- Off-by-one errors: When expanding around the center, indices can easily go out of bounds if not checked properly.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem demonstrates the pattern of expanding a potential solution from a central point which is applicable in various string and array problems involving symmetry or contiguous subproblems.

6,"LeetCode Problem 6 is titled ""ZigZag Conversion"". Here is an extensive analysis of the problem:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
The problem statement defines ZigZag Conversion in a particular way, asking us to write the given string `""PAYPALISHIRING""` in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this (for 3 rows):

```
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
```

...and then read the string line by line, which would give us `""PAHNAPLSIIGYIR""` as the output.

The pattern forms a zigzag (or a wave-like structure), where each letter is placed diagonally in a pattern from top-down and then bottom-up, alternating between these two directions.

Depending on the number of rows specified, the zigzag wave can be steeper or shallower.

The nuanced challenges in the problem include figuring out:
- How to effectively map the indices of the original string to their respective positions in the zigzag pattern.
- Ensuring that characters are added to appropriate rows depending on their position in the input string.
- Efficiently constructing the result string without actually building the two-dimensional zigzag pattern array (which would be memory-inefficient).

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
To solve the problem, several approaches can be taken:

1. **Simulation Approach**:
   - Simulate the writing process by iterating over the characters in the input string and placing each character in the correct position in a 2D grid representing the zigzag pattern.
   - After filling the grid, read the characters row by row to construct the output string.

2. **Visit by Row** (More efficient):
   - Identify the pattern by which characters are added to each row.
   - Realize that each cycle (top-to-bottom and bottom-to-top) covers `2 * numRows - 2` characters.
   - Iterate over the rows, and for each row, calculate the indices of characters that belong to that row in the original string.
   - Concatenate the characters extracted from the input string, following the calculated indices for each row.

The second approach is generally preferred, as it is more efficient regarding memory usage and has a simpler implementation. You don't need to create a 2D matrix; instead, you can use simple arithmetic to determine where each character will go.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
Let's implement the Visit by Row approach in Python:

```python
def convert(s, numRows):
    if numRows == 1 or numRows >= len(s):
        return s

    ret = []
    cycleLen = 2 * numRows - 2

    for i in range(numRows):
        for j in range(0, len(s) - i, cycleLen):
            ret.append(s[j + i])
            if i != 0 and i != numRows - 1 and j + cycleLen - i < len(s):
                ret.append(s[j + cycleLen - i])

    return """".join(ret)
```

Let's break down the code above:

- We start by handling two edge cases:
    ```python
    if numRows == 1 or numRows >= len(s):
        return s
    ```
    If the number of rows is 1 or greater than or equal to the length of the string, the zigzag pattern doesn't alter the input, so we return the original string.

- `cycleLen = 2 * numRows - 2` calculates the length of one full zigzag cycle. This will be the gap between characters in the same row.

- We then iterate over each row using `for i in range(numRows):`.

- For each row, we iterate over the characters in the original string that belong to this row:
    ```python
    for j in range(0, len(s) - i, cycleLen):
        ret.append(s[j + i])
    ```
    Here, we skip `cycleLen` indices in each iteration since that's where the next character in the same row will be found.

- We also add the 'diagonal' characters except for the first and last rows:
    ```python
    if i != 0 and i != numRows - 1 and j + cycleLen - i < len(s):
        ret.append(s[j + cycleLen - i])
    ```
    These characters are found at an index that is `cycleLen - i` away from the indices where we found the vertical characters.

- Finally, we join all the characters and return:
    ```python
    return """".join(ret)
    ```

### Elaborate Examples
Let's consider the string `""PAYPALISHIRING""` with `numRows = 4`. The zigzag pattern would look like:

```
P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I
```

Following the algorithm above, we would collect characters in this order:

- Row 1: `P`, `I`, `N`
- Row 2: `A`, `L S`, `I G`
- Row 3: `Y A`, `H R`
- Row 4: `P`, `I`

The final result string is `""PINALSIGYAHRPI""`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because we iterate over each character in the string exactly once during the construction of our final string.

The space complexity of the function is also O(n), as we need to store the output string, which in the worst-case scenario will be the same size as the input string.

### Real-World Applications
The concept of rearranging data into different patterns can relate to various real-world scenarios, such as formatting data for display, digital signal processing, and encoding data in a way that can accommodate error correction.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks
A common pitfall is neglecting edge cases, like where `numRows` is 1 or very large. Another is trying to construct the entire grid, which is not memory efficient. The trick lies in observing and exploiting the regular pattern that each row's characters follow.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem falls under the category of string manipulation and pattern recognition. By identifying the inherent pattern in how characters are allocated to each row, we can formulate an efficient solution.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems
Related LeetCode problems that involve pattern recognition in strings or matrices include:
- 54. Spiral Matrix
- 59. Spiral Matrix II
- 48. Rotate Image
- 29. Divide Two Integers (bit manipulation but also involves pattern recognition)

Each of these problems requires careful observation of the patterns in which values are laid out or traversed. The skill of pattern recognition applied here can be similarly useful in solving them."
7,"LeetCode Problem 7, titled ""Reverse Integer,"" asks you to reverse an integer. Here is a detailed breakdown of each aspect of the problem:

### Problem Statement

Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed. If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-2³¹, 2³¹ - 1], then return 0.

### Constraints

- The input is a 32-bit signed integer. In computing, this means it can represent values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
- You must handle the overflow condition, which means if the reversed integer exceeds the 32-bit signed integer range, the function should return 0.

### Examples

Input: `x = 123`
Output: `321`

Input: `x = -123`
Output: `-321`

Input: `x = 120`
Output: `21`

Input: `x = 0`
Output: `0`

### Solution Strategy

The primary strategy to solve this problem is as follows:

1. Handle the input integer sign, which can be done by storing the sign as a separate variable and working with the absolute value of the input.
2. Reverse the integer digit by digit. This can usually be done by taking the last digit of the integer (by taking the modulus of the integer by 10), adding it to a result variable that is multiplied by 10 (to shift the previously added digits one place to the left), and then removing the last digit from the original integer by doing an integer division by 10.
3. Check for overflow. After each digit is added, ensure that the result has not exceeded the 32-bit signed integer limit.
4. Re-apply the original sign to the result before returning it.

### Edge Cases and Pitfalls

- Edge cases include handling 0, the smallest possible integer `-2,147,483,648`, which cannot be handled the same as other numbers due to the sign (its absolute value is outside the positive range of 32-bit signed integers), and numbers whose reverse would overflow.
- Common pitfalls include forgetting to reapply the original integer sign and not checking properly for overflows.

### Python Code Explanation

```python
def reverse(x: int) -> int:
    INT_MAX = 2**31 - 1
    INT_MIN = -2**31

    result = 0
    sign = 1 if x > 0 else -1
    x = abs(x)

    while x != 0:
        pop = x % 10  # Get the last digit
        x //= 10  # Remove the last digit

        # Check for overflow
        if result > INT_MAX // 10 or (result == INT_MAX // 10 and pop > 7):
            return 0
        if result < INT_MIN // 10 or (result == INT_MIN // 10 and pop < -8):
            return 0

        result = result * 10 + pop  # Add the digit to the reversed number

    return sign * result
```

Let's break down each part of this code:

- `INT_MAX` and `INT_MIN` represent the maximum and minimum possible values for a signed 32-bit integer, which are precomputed for easier checks later.
- `result` is initialized to 0, which will be our reversed number.
- `sign` is determined by checking if `x` is positive or negative.
- `x` is converted to its absolute value so that we only need to handle positive numbers while reversing.
- The while loop is used to reverse the digits of `x`. With each iteration, `pop` holds the last digit of `x`, and `x` is then divided by 10 to remove that last digit.
- After retrieving and removing the last digit, we check for overflow conditions by comparing the current `result` and the digit to be added (`pop`) against the maximum/minimum thresholds adjusted by the decimal place.
- If there is no overflow, `result` is updated by shifting its digits to the left (multiplying by 10) and adding the new digit `pop`.
- Once the loop is completed (when `x` becomes 0), we multiply the `result` by the original `sign` to regain the correct sign of the number and return it.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(log(x)), where x is the input integer. This is because the number of digits in x is proportional to log10(x), and we process each digit exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) because we use a fixed amount of space regardless of the size of the input number.

### Real-World Applications

This problem has relevance in any computational context where the manipulation of numerical values and their representations are required, such as:
- Data processing and transformations in financial computations.
- Algorithms dealing with palindromes or number symmetry in cryptography.
- Error checking mechanisms where reversals might be used to detect anomalies.

8,"LeetCode Problem #8 is titled ""String to Integer (atoi)"". This problem is designed to mimic the behavior of the `atoi` function in C++, which converts a string to an integer. The purpose of this problem is to practice parsing and converting strings to numerical values while handling edge cases and ensuring robust error checking. Below, I will provide an extensive breakdown of the problem, discuss solution strategies, examine Python code in detail, provide examples, analyze complexity, explore real-world applications, consider common pitfalls and tricks, identify problem patterns, and list related problems on LeetCode.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
The problem statement requires you to implement a function `myAtoi(str)` that converts a string to a numerical integer. The function should follow these rules:

1. **Whitespace Trim**: The function should discard any leading whitespace until the first non-whitespace character is found.

2. **Sign Determination**: If the next character (after the whitespace removal) is a plus ('+') sign or minus ('-') sign, it should be taken into account for the sign of the integer. This character can only occur once; additional occurrences are not allowed and should result in stopping the conversion.

3. **Overflow Handling**: If the integer overflows, meaning it is greater than the maximum positive integer (`2^31 - 1`) or less than the minimum negative integer (`-2^31`), the function should return the corresponding boundary value.

4. **Non-digit Characters**: After the optional sign character, any subsequent non-digit character stops the numerical parsing.

5. **String Begins with Non-numerical Character**: If the string starts with a non-numerical character after whitespaces are trimmed (and it's not a sign), the function should return 0, because no valid conversion could be performed.

6. **Empty or Only Whitespace Strings**: If the string is empty or contains only whitespace characters, the function should return 0.

The problem also stipulates that no library functions like `int()` (except for character-to-integer transformation), string trimming functions or regular expressions should be used for the implementation.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
The strategy to solve this problem usually involves a step-by-step approach that mirrors the rules given in the problem statement.

1. Trim leading whitespace by iterating through the string until a non-whitespace character is encountered.
2. Check for a sign and store it.
3. Iterate through the characters until a non-digit is encountered, accumulating the result as an integer.
4. Handle potential overflow by checking the accumulated number against the predefined overflow boundaries.
5. Convert the accumulated number to a negative number if a negative sign was found.
6. Return the result.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
Let me write a piece of Python code to address each step in detail:

```python
def myAtoi(s: str) -> int:
    MAX_INT = 2**31 - 1
    MIN_INT = -2**31
    i = 0
    n = len(s)
    # Step 1: Trim leading whitespace
    while i < n and s[i] == ' ':
        i += 1
    
    if i == n:
        return 0  # String contains only white spaces or is empty
    
    # Step 2: Check for sign
    sign = 1
    if s[i] == '+' or s[i] == '-':
        sign = -1 if s[i] == '-' else 1
        i += 1
    
    result = 0
    # Step 3: Iterate through digits and accumulate result
    while i < n and s[i].isdigit():
        result = result * 10 + int(s[i])
        i += 1
        
        # Step 4: Overflow handling
        if result > MAX_INT:
            return MAX_INT if sign == 1 else MIN_INT
            
    # Step 5: Account for the sign
    result *= sign
    
    # Clamp result within the integer range to handle possible overflow
    if result < MIN_INT:
        return MIN_INT
    if result > MAX_INT:
        return MAX_INT

    return result
```

### Elaborate Examples
Let's consider a few examples to demonstrate how the function works:

- `myAtoi(""42"")` should return `42`.
- `myAtoi(""   -42"")` trims whitespace and understands the negative sign, returning `-42`.
- `myAtoi(""4193 with words"")` stops parsing at the space character and returns `4193`.
- `myAtoi(""words and 987"")` begins with words, so it should return `0`.
- `myAtoi(""-91283472332"")` overflows the 32-bit integer range and should return `-2147483648`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: The solution is linear, `O(n)`, because it involves a single pass through the string, where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Space Complexity**: The solution uses a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size, so the space complexity is `O(1)`.

### Real-World Applications
Functions similar to `atoi` are used in real-world scenarios for parsing input data, converting strings to numbers in configurations, or as part of data preprocessing steps in algorithms where numerical analysis is required.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks
Common pitfalls in this problem involve not handling edge cases properly, such as:
- Not accounting for leading whitespace.
- Allowing multiple signs.
- Not stopping at the first non-digit character.
- Failing to handle integer overflow.

Tricks that help: 
- Use a finite state machine approach to elegantly traverse through different conditions.
- Remember to multiply the accumulated number by 10 before adding the next digit to shift the current digits leftward in decimal representation.
- Handle overflow by checking if the current result exceeds the boundary when divided by 10. If you wait until after multiplication by 10, it might be too late because the number may have already overflowed.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem is a string parsing problem that requires careful iteration and condition checking. Recognizing patterns of character classes (whitespace, digit, sign) is crucial. Similar problems often require the same attention to input validation and conditions.

In #224, similar techniques are applied to interpreting mathematical expressions, making it a complex extension of the parsing principles used in #8."
9,"LeetCode Problem 9 is titled ""Palindrome Number."" Let me give you an extensive breakdown of this problem, including the description, potential approaches to solving it, an in-depth analysis of the solution including time and space complexity, and some applications and related problems.

### Problem Description

The task in this problem is to determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, `121` is a palindrome while `123` is not. The constraints given are:

- The integer should not be converted to a string for the comparison.
- Negative numbers are not palindromic (since they have a '-' that cannot be at both ends).

### Solution Rationale

One might think of the straightforward solution which involves converting the integer to a string and then simply comparing the string with its reverse. However, the problem states that we are not allowed to convert the integer to a string.

Thus, we have to think about other strategies that involve numbers only. Here are two basic algorithm ideas to solve the problem:

**Reversing Half of the Number:**
- Integers are not palindromes if they are negative or if they end with `0`, but are not `0` itself (since no palindrome number will have a leading zero).
- The algorithm works by reversing the last half of the number and then comparing it to the first half.
- If the two halves are the same, then it’s a palindrome.
- We can determine we've reached the halfway point by checking when the original number is less than or equal to the reversed number.

**Using Remainders:**
- You can continuously strip off the last digit of the number by dividing the number by 10 and taking the remainder.
- At the same time, you can build a new reversed number by taking these remainders and adding them to a new number that is multiplied by 10 each time (to shift it to the left).

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's focus on the first method, reversing only half of the number, as it is more efficient. Here’s the Python code that implements the solution to the problem:

```python
def isPalindrome(x):
    # Special cases:
    # As discussed above, when x < 0, x is not a palindrome.
    # Also if the last digit of the number is 0, in order to be a palindrome,
    # the first digit of the number also needs to be 0.
    # Only 0 satisfy this property.
    if x < 0 or (x % 10 == 0 and x != 0):
        return False
    
    reversed_number = 0
    while x > reversed_number:
        reversed_number = reversed_number * 10 + x % 10
        x //= 10
    
    # When the length is an odd number, we can get rid of the middle digit by reversed_number // 10
    # For example when the input is 12321, at the end of the while loop we get x = 12, reversed_number = 123,
    # since the middle digit doesn't matter in palindrome (it will always equal to itself),
    # we can safely get rid of it.
    return x == reversed_number or x == reversed_number // 10
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: Since we are processing half of the digits in the input number, the time complexity is O(log10(n)), where n is the input number. This is because the number of digits in a number is proportional to the log of the number.

- **Space Complexity**: We are using a fixed amount of space (a few integer variables), so the space complexity is O(1), which means it requires constant space.

### Examples

Here are a few examples to demonstrate how the code works:

- `isPalindrome(121)` will return `True` because when the while loop ends, `x` is `12` and `reversed_number` is `12`.
- `isPalindrome(-121)` will return `False` because of the initial check for negative numbers.
- `isPalindrome(10)` will return `False` because of the check for the trailing zero.

### Real-World Applications

Detecting palindromes has more of a mathematical curiosity than direct practical applications. However, it could be a useful component of algorithms in fields like genetics where palindromic sequences are important in DNA strings, or text-processing applications that handle symmetrical data.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Remember to consider the edge cases, like a single-digit number (always a palindrome), negative numbers, and numbers ending with zero.
- It's easy to make a mistake by not considering when to stop the reversal (i.e., when to determine we have reached the half of the number).

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem is a great example of a pattern where you deal with numbers without converting them into strings or arrays. It involves applying mathematical operations to achieve the result. This pattern is common in problems that want to test your understanding of number manipulation and arithmetic operations in programming.

10,"LeetCode Problem 10 is the ""Regular Expression Matching"" problem. This problem is known for its complexity and tricky corner cases. It falls under the dynamic programming category, but it can also be approached using recursion. Let's dissect this problem in detail, look at various solution strategies, understand Python-specific implementation nuances, go through examples, analyze the complexity, consider real-world applications, discuss common pitfalls and tricks, identify patterns for solving similar problems, and link to related problems.

## Extensive Problem Breakdown
The problem statement is as follows: Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'`, where:
- `'.'` Matches any single character.
- `'*'` Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Understanding the nuances of `'*'` is crucial because it doesn't just match a previous character but specifies that the character before the asterisk can be present in the string zero or more times.

## In-Depth Solution Rationale
There are two main solution strategies for this problem: recursion and dynamic programming.

1. **Recursion**:
   The recursive approach involves breaking the problem down into smaller problems. We check, character by character, whether the string and the pattern match, considering the special characters '.' and '*'. When encountering a '*', we need to consider multiple cases: the '*' represents zero instances of the character, one instance, or multiple instances.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   The dynamic programming approach is often more efficient for this problem. It involves creating a 2D table that stores the results of subproblems. Each cell in the table `(i, j)` represents whether `s[0...i]` matches `p[0...j]`. We iterate through the string and the pattern and fill up the table based on the state transitions governed by the characters encountered (plain characters, '.', and '*').

Dynamic programming is usually preferred for this problem because it avoids redundant computations that occur in the recursive approach, especially for patterns with multiple '*' characters.

We could use either recursive or dynamic programming in Python to solve this problem. Below, I'll provide an example using dynamic programming:

```python
def isMatch(s, p):
    dp = [[False] * (len(p) + 1) for _ in range(len(s) + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = True
    
    # Handle patterns like a* or a*b* or a*b*c*
    for j in range(1, len(p) + 1):
        if p[j - 1] == '*':
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 2]
    
    for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):
        for j in range(1, len(p) + 1):
            if p[j - 1] == '.' or s[i - 1] == p[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            elif p[j - 1] == '*':
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 2] or (dp[i - 1][j] and (s[i - 1] == p[j - 2] or p[j - 2] == '.'))
    
    return dp[-1][-1]
```

Here is a detailed breakdown of this code:

- `dp[i][j]` is `True` if `s[0...i-1]` matches `p[0...j-1]` and `False` otherwise.
- We first initialize the DP table with `False` and set `dp[0][0]` to `True`, indicating that empty string and empty pattern match.
- We then handle the cases where patterns with '*' appear at the beginning.
- Next, we fill out the 2D table. If the current characters in `s` and `p` match or if the current character in `p` is '.', we inherit the value from `dp[i-1][j-1]` because we can ignore these two matching characters.
- If the pattern has a '*', there are two cases: 
    - `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 2]` handles the case where the '*' means zero occurrences of the preceding element.
    - `(dp[i - 1][j] and (s[i - 1] == p[j - 2] or p[j - 2] == '.'))` handles the case where '*' causes the preceding elements to match additional characters in `s`.
- Finally, we return the value of `dp[-1][-1]`, which signifies whether the entire `s` matches `p`.

## Elaborate Examples
Let's consider some examples and edge cases:
- `s = ""aa"", p = ""a""` should return `False` because the pattern does not match the entire string.
- `s = ""aa"", p = ""a*""` should return `True` because `'*'` allows `a` to be repeated, matching the entire string.
- `s = ""ab"", p = "".*""` should return `True` because `"".*""` can match any characters.
- `s = ""aab"", p = ""c*a*b""` should return `True`. Here, `'c*'` matches zero 'c's, and `'a*'` repeats 'a' twice.

## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of the dynamic programming solution is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the length of the string `s` and `n` is the length of the pattern `p`. Each cell in the DP table represents a subproblem, and there are `m * n` subproblems to solve.

The space complexity is also `O(m * n)` for the DP table.

## Real-World Applications
Regular expression matching is a fundamental technique used in parsing inputs, data validation, search engines, and text editors. This problem can help us better understand how regular expressions work under the hood and enhance our ability to use them effectively in real-life applications.

## Common Pitfalls and Tricks
One of the common pitfalls is not handling the '*' character correctly, especially when it means zero occurrences of the previous character. It's also easy to miss that the '.' character matches any character, which is different from most characters that need to match exactly.

A trick to handle patterns like `a*` or `b*` at the beginning of the pattern is to loop through the pattern and set `dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 2]` at the start.

## Problem Pattern Identification
The problem is a classic example of dynamic programming, where large problems can be broken down into smaller, overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently. Recognizing when to use a 2D table to represent states is crucial in dynamic programming problems.

11,"LeetCode Problem 11 is the ""Container With Most Water"" problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of the problem and its solution.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

In this problem, you are given an array `height` of integer numbers where each integer represents a point on the coordinate plane and the value represents the height of a vertical line drawn from that point up. The array indices are the horizontal positions of each line.

Your goal is to find two lines that together with the X-axis form a container such that the container contains the most water.

Remember, you can't slant the container and the amount of water contained is the minimum height of the two lines multiplied by the distance between them (or the number of indices between the two lines).

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, one might consider a brute force solution, which is to check every possible pair of lines and calculate the area of the water container they form. However, the brute force approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array, which is not efficient for large arrays.

A more efficient approach is the two-pointer technique, where you initialize two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the array. At each step, you move the pointer pointing at the shorter line towards the other pointer, then calculate and store the area if it is larger than the maximum area found so far. The intuition behind this is that by moving the shorter line inward, there's a possibility of finding a taller line that, when paired with the opposite side's line, might contain a larger area.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Here is a possible Python solution using the two-pointer approach:

```python
def maxArea(height):
    max_water = 0  # Initial maximum water is set to 0
    left = 0  # Pointer to the start of the array
    right = len(height) - 1  # Pointer to the end of the array

    while left < right:
        # Calculate the height and width
        min_height = min(height[left], height[right])
        width = right - left
        # Calculate the area
        area = min_height * width
        
        # Update max_water if the found area is greater
        max_water = max(max_water, area)

        # Move the pointers
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1  # Move left pointer to the right
        else:
            right -= 1  # Move right pointer to the left

    return max_water
```

Let's break it down:

- `max_water`: This variable keeps track of the maximum water container found so far.
- `left` and `right`: These are pointers that start at each end of the array.
- In the `while` loop, we calculate the height of the container as the minimum of the heights of the two lines being pointed to by `left` and `right`, and the width as the distance between them.
- We calculate the `area` and update `max_water` if this `area` is greater than `max_water`.
- Depending on which line is shorter, we increment `left` or decrement `right` and repeat the process.
- We continue this until `left` and `right` meet.
- Finally, we return `max_water`.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's say we have the input array `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`. Initially, `left = 0` and `right = 8`. The area calculated is min(1,7) \* (8-0) = 7. Moving the left pointer: `left = 1` and `right` stays at 8. Now the area is min(8,7) \* (8-1) = 56, which is our new maximum. We will keep repeating this process, updating the maximum water accordingly. In the end, the maximum area of water that can be trapped is 56.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, because we are passing through the array only once with two pointers moving towards each other.

The space complexity is O(1) because we use a constant amount of additional space—only variables for the pointers and max water calculation.

### Real-World Applications

This type of problem, while abstract in its formulation, can represent various real-world optimization scenarios. For example, it could be a simplified model for container packing or resource allocation where the height represents limitations on resource capacity, and the width represents the time or distance over which the resources can be utilized.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

A common pitfall for this problem is to assume that the best solution must involve the tallest line in the `height` array. This is not always true as the best solution may involve shorter lines that are farther apart.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem exemplifies a common problem-solving pattern known as the two-pointer technique. Recognizing when to apply this pattern is crucial in solving similar array problems that involve finding a pair of elements that satisfy certain conditions.

- Problem 42: Trapping Rain Water

Each problem has a variant of finding matches or optima within an array, and the two-pointer technique can be applied effectively in these scenarios. The key takeaway in these problems is often to leverage the sorted property of the array or to reduce the time complexity by avoiding unnecessary comparisons."
12,"LeetCode problem number 12 is titled ""Integer to Roman"". This problem asks you to convert an integer to a Roman numeral.

## Problem Statement

Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral. Roman numerals are represented by combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet (I, V, X, L, C, D, M). Here are the basic rules:

- The numbers 1, 2, and 3 are represented by 'I', 'II', and 'III'.
- The number 4 is written as 'IV' (one before five).
- The number 5 is represented by 'V'.
- The number 9 is written as 'IX' (one before ten).
- The tens follow a similar pattern: 10 (X), 40 (XL), 50 (L), 90 (XC), 100 (C), 400 (CD), 500 (D), and 900 (CM).

Roman numerals consist of seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M.

Here are their values:

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not 'IIII'. Instead, the number four is written as 'IV'. Because the one is before the five, we subtract it making four. This rule applies when the base symbol (I, X, C) is immediately followed by a symbol that represents a numeral that is equal to or larger than five times the base symbol's value.

For example:
3 is represented as ""III"", 58 is represented as ""LVIII"" (L = 50, V = 5, III = 3), and 1994 is represented as ""MCMXCIV"" (M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4).

### Constraints:
- 1 <= num <= 3999

## Solution Strategy

The key to solving this problem is to understand how Roman numerals are constructed. Since Roman numerals are formed by combining symbols according to their values with special rules for substractive notation (like IV instead of IIII), we can solve the problem by breaking down the integer into component parts that correspond to Roman numeral symbols.

An efficient way to do this is to have a mapping of the integer values that have direct Roman numeral equivalents. We can then iterate through this mapping in decreasing order of integer value, subtracting from the integer and appending the corresponding Roman numerals to our result until the integer is reduced to zero.

## Python Code Explanation

Here is a sample Python code that implements the above strategy:

```python
def intToRoman(num):
    # Map of integer to Roman numeral equivalents
    val_to_roman = [
        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), 
        (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),
        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), 
        (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),
        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), 
        (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), 
        (1, 'I')]
    
    # Resultant Roman numeral string
    roman = """"
    
    # Loop through the tuples in val_to_roman
    for i, r in val_to_roman:
        while num >= i:
            roman += r
            num -= i
    
    return roman
```

In this implementation:
- We iterate over the list of tuples `val_to_roman`, each containing a value and its Roman numeral representation.
- If the current number `num` is greater than or equal to `i`, the corresponding Roman numeral `r` is added to the `roman` string, and `i` is subtracted from `num`.
- The process is repeated until `num` is less than `i`.
- Once we have checked all possible values in `val_to_roman`, `roman` will contain the correct Roman numeral representation of the initial integer .

## Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(1) - The algorithm runs in constant time because the input number has a constraint from 1 to 3999, and there are a finite number of Roman numerals, so the maximum number of iterations is fixed and does not grow with the size of the input number.

Space Complexity: O(1) - The space used by the `val_to_roman` array is fixed, and the `roman` string will also contain a finite number of characters based on the input constraints.

## Real-World Application

The conversion of numbers to Roman numerals might not be very common in modern computing applications, but it is a good example that showcases the importance of understanding numeral systems and how they can be encoded into computer programs. It also serves as an exercise in string manipulation, which is a common task in many real-world applications such as data formatting, report generation, and user interfaces.

## Common Pitfalls and Tricks

One common pitfall is misunderstanding the Roman numeral system and how the subtractive notation works. Knowing that IV is used instead of IIII and IX is used instead of VIIII, for example, is crucial to getting the correct result. A good grasp of these rules is necessary not just for coding the solution but also for understanding why it works.

A helpful trick in this sort of problem is to start with the largest values and work your way down. This simplifies the logic and ensures that you're adding the largest possible Roman symbols first.

## Problem Pattern Identification

This problem is a form of ""mapping"" where you are transforming one system of representing numbers into another. This pattern is found in various other problems where you need to convert between different units or encodings. Recognizing the mapping pattern can help you quickly identify the need for a conversion table or similar structure to aid in the transformation.

13,"LeetCode Problem 13 is titled ""Roman to Integer."" The problem is about converting a Roman numeral to an integer. Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M.

Here's the specifics of the Roman numerals:

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

In Roman numerals, two things are important to keep in mind: 

1. Normally, Roman numerals are written from largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. As the one is before the five, we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX.
2. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
   - I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
   - X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
   - C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a Roman numeral, the task is to convert it to an integer. A string is given, and you must convert it to the integer it represents.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The basic strategy to solve this problem is to iterate through the given Roman numeral and sum the value of each symbol. However, we must handle the cases where subtraction is involved. To efficiently handle this, we can:

1. Map each Roman numeral symbol to its integer value.
2. Scan through the Roman numeral from left to right, adding the value of each symbol to a running total.
3. Check if the current symbol is less than the symbol to its right. If it is, we subtract its value twice because we have already added it once, and we need to negate the addition to account for the subtraction rule.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's say we are given the Python function `romanToInt(s)`, and we want to implement it:

```python
def romanToInt(s):
    roman_map = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}
    total = 0
    
    # We iterate through each Roman numeral character
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # If the current value is less than the next value, subtract twice the current value
        if i < len(s) - 1 and roman_map[s[i]] < roman_map[s[i + 1]]:
            total -= 2 * roman_map[s[i]]
        
        # Add the value of the current Roman numeral to the total
        total += roman_map[s[i]]
    
    return total
```

In this code:
- We first create a dictionary `roman_map` that maps each Roman numeral symbol to its integer value.
- We initialize `total` to 0 to keep track of the running total.
- We loop over the input string `s`, using `for i in range(len(s))` to index each character.
- Inside the loop, we check if `roman_map[s[i]]` is less than `roman_map[s[i + 1]]`, and if so, we subtract twice the value of the current numeral from the total, because we're in a subtraction case.
- In every iteration, we add the value of the current Roman numeral to the total since that's what we would normally do if there wasn't a subtraction rule.
- Finally, we return `total`.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's look at some examples:

Example 1:
```
Input: s = ""III""
Output: 3
```
The function would iterate over each 'I' and add 1 to the total each time, resulting in 3 since there's no need to subtract.

Example 2:
```
Input: s = ""IV""
Output: 4
```
The function recognizes that 'I' is followed by 'V'. Thus, it subtracts 2 * 1 (2) because 'I' was added earlier and then needs to be subtracted to correctly form 4. The 'V' adds 5, so the total is 4.

Example 3:
```
Input: s = ""IX""
Output: 9
```
Similar to Example 2, 'I' gets subtracted and 'X' adds 10. The total is therefore 9.

### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the Roman numeral string. We simply iterate through the string once.

The space complexity is O(1) since the storage used, a dictionary with a fixed number of Roman numeral mappings, does not increase with the size of the input string.

### Real-World Applications

Roman numerals are often seen in various places such as clock faces, book chapter enumerations, and movie release years. Being able to convert them to integers programmatically can be useful in various applications where processing or indexing such information is required, such as in databases or when sorting items in collections.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

A common mistake is to overlook the subtraction rule for Roman numerals and simply add up all of the numerical values. This will lead to incorrect results for numerals like 'IV' or 'IX'. The trick is to check the value of the current numeral against the value of the one following it and subtract if necessary.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem introduces the pattern of value mapping and sequential comparison within a string. Recognizing how adjacent characters can affect computation is a common pattern in string processing tasks, which can be beneficial when solving similar problems.

14,"LeetCode Problem 14 is ""Longest Common Prefix"". Below, I’ll dive into each aspect of this problem to give you a comprehensive understanding.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The problem asks for the longest common prefix that is present in an array of strings. If there is no common prefix among all the strings, the function should return an empty string.

Here are some crucial nuances to understand:

1. A prefix is only considered common if it is present at the start of all the strings in the array.
2. The prefix can be an entire string if one string contains another entirely at the start.
3. If the array is empty or contains only empty strings, the result is an empty string.
4. The case of letters matters — ""a"" is not considered the same as ""A"".

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
There are multiple approaches to solving this problem. Let me discuss a few before diving into the preferred method:

1. **Horizontal Scanning**: Compare the prefixes of pairs of strings, one by one, and keep updating the longest common prefix until you go through all the strings.

2. **Vertical Scanning**: Look at each character position in the strings one by one. If all strings have the same character at that position, keep it in the prefix, otherwise break the loop.

3. **Divide and Conquer**: Divide the array of strings into two halves, find the longest common prefix for each half, and then combine these prefixes together to create the longest common prefix for the full array.

4. **Binary Search**: Use a binary search to find the smallest length of a string in the array, and then use that length to find the common prefix.

5. **Using Trie**: Build a trie (prefix tree) of all the strings and then traverse the trie to find the common prefix.

The **Vertical Scanning** approach is often preferred because of its simplicity and because it does well with cases where the strings are large, and the common prefix is short because it only compares characters up to the length of the shortest string.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
I will use the Vertical Scanning approach. Here’s a line-by-line breakdown:

```python
def longestCommonPrefix(strs):
    if not strs:  # If the list is empty, return an empty prefix.
        return """"
    
    for i in range(len(strs[0])):  # Loop through the characters of the first string.
        char = strs[0][i]  # Take the current character.
        for string in strs:  # Loop through the other strings.
            if i == len(string) or string[i] != char:  # If the character isn't present at the same position, or strings differ.
                return strs[0][:i]  # Return the substring up to this point.
                
    return strs[0]  # If we finished without returning, the whole first string is a prefix.
```

1. We start by checking if `strs` is empty. If it is, we return an empty string as there is no common prefix.

2. We use the first string in `strs` as our reference and iterate through its characters with `for i in range(len(strs[0]))`.

3. For each character index `i`, we assign `char` to be the character at this index in the reference string.

4. We then loop through each string in `strs` with `for string in strs` and check two things:
    - If the current index `i` is the same as the length of the current string `string`, this means we've reached the end of one of the strings and should return the prefix identified up to this point.
    - If the character at index `i` of the current string `string` does not match `char`, we break because we've found a discrepancy.

5. If neither of those two conditions is met for all strings, we continue to the next character.

6. If we exit the loop normally (without returning within the loop), this means the first string is entirely a common prefix, so we return it as the result.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's consider a few examples to illustrate this:

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [""flower"",""flow"",""flight""]
Output: ""fl""
```
Here the longest common prefix is ""fl"", as it is present at the start of all strings.

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [""dog"",""racecar"",""car""]
Output: """"
```
There is no common prefix, as no prefix is shared across all strings from the start.

**Example 3:**
```
Input: ["""",""b""]
Output: """"
```
Even though we have a string, the other is empty, hence no common prefix.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity of the Vertical Scanning method can be seen as O(S), where S is the sum of all characters in all strings, in the worst case. This worst-case occurs when all strings are the same or when the difference is at the end of the strings.

The space complexity is O(1) since we are only using constant extra space.

### Real-World Applications:
Finding the longest common prefix can be useful in scenarios like autocompletion or grouping items based on common starting words. For example, you could have an application that suggests the rest of a user’s input in a search bar, or organizes files with similar names.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
Be wary of empty arrays or arrays with empty string(s). Ensure that you compare until the length of the shortest string to avoid `IndexError`. Always test for cases where strings are the same or sub-strings of one another.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem follows a pattern of string comparison and involves recognizing the shortest string's character positions as limiting factors and iterating through multiple strings in tandem.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:
Similar problems typically involve string manipulation or comparison, such as:

- LeetCode Problem 28 - ""Implement strStr()"" (search for a substring within a string).
- LeetCode Problem 58 - ""Length of Last Word"" (finding the length of the last word in a string).
- LeetCode Problem 387 - ""First Unique Character in a String"" (finding the first non-repeating character in a string).

In each of these, understanding how to iterate and manipulate strings in Python will be very beneficial."
15,"LeetCode Problem #15 is the ""3Sum"" problem. Here, I'll provide a detailed explanation of the problem, strategies for solving it, followed by Python code implementation and analysis.

### Problem Breakdown:

The problem statement is as follows: Given an array `nums` of `n` integers, are there elements a, b, c in `nums` such that `a + b + c = 0`? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero. 

The key aspects of the problem:

1. The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
2. The order of the triplets does not matter.
3. The problem is essentially asking for all combinations of three numbers that add up to zero.

### Subtle nuances:

- Triplets meaning specifically three numbers.
- Unique triplets imply we must handle duplicates in the input array.
- The solution requires handling negative and positive numbers, including zeros.
- The array is not guaranteed to be sorted.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

#### Approach 1: Naive/Brute Force:

The most intuitive approach would be to check every possible triplet in the array using three nested loops. For each possible combination, we can check if the sum is zero and if it's not already in the solution set. However, this would be highly inefficient with a time complexity of O(n^3).

#### Approach 2: Two Pointers Method (Optimized):

The most efficient way to solve this problem is using the following procedure:

1. **Sorting**: First, sort the array. Sorting helps us avoid considering duplicate triplets and makes the two-pointer approach possible.
2. **Iterate with Two Pointers**: For each element in the array:

    a. If the current element is the same as the previous one, skip it to avoid duplicates.

    b. Set two pointers: one at the element immediately after the current element, and the other at the end of the array.

    c. Move the pointers towards each other while summing the values at the two pointers and the current element:

      - If the sum of the three elements is less than zero, move the left pointer to the right (we need a larger number because the array is sorted in ascending order).

      - If the sum is greater than zero, move the right pointer to the left (we need a smaller number).

      - If the sum is zero, add the triplet to the result and move both pointers, making sure to skip any duplicates.

#### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

```python
def threeSum(nums):
    nums.sort()  # Sort the array
    result = []
    
    for i in range(len(nums)-2):
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
            continue  # Skip duplicates for the first element of the triplet
        
        left, right = i+1, len(nums)-1  # Set two pointers
        
        while left < right:
            total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
            
            if total < 0:  # If total is less than zero, we need a larger number
                left += 1
            elif total > 0:  # If total is greater than zero, we need a smaller number
                right -= 1
            else:
                # Found a triplet
                result.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])
                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left+1]:
                    left += 1  # Skip duplicates for the second element of the triplet
                while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right-1]:
                    right -= 1  # Skip duplicates for the third element of the triplet
                left += 1
                right -= 1
                
    return result
```

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2). Although there is a nested loop structure, the two-pointer approach means we only go through the n-2 elements linearly for each of the outer loop iterations.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) or O(n), depending on the sorting algorithm used. If the sorting does not use any extra space, the space complexity is O(1). However, Python's built-in `sort()` function has a space complexity of O(n) because of the Timsort algorithm it uses.

### Real-World Applications:

This problem has various applications such as in computational geometry to find triplet points that can form triangles with certain properties or in financial computations to find triple investments that can cancel out each other's risk.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Failing to handle duplicates properly can lead to incorrect results.
- It's important to move the left and right pointers correctly after finding a valid triplet to avoid skipping potential valid triplets.
- Another trick is to avoid unnecessary iterations by breaking early if the current number is greater than zero (since the array is sorted, no further triplets can sum to zero).

### Problem Pattern Identification:

The two-pointer strategy is a common pattern for array and string problems involving a sorted list of elements. Recognizing that a problem could be efficiently solved using a two-pointer approach can drastically reduce time complexity.

### Similar LeetCode Problems:

- Two Sum (ID: 1)
- 3Sum Closest (ID: 16)
- 4Sum (ID: 18)
- Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted (ID: 167)

Each of these problems involves finding elements in a sorted array that meet certain criteria, often a specific sum, and can benefit from the same two-pointer technique. The skills and insights obtained from solving the ""3Sum"" problem can be transferred to tackle these related problems as well."
16,"LeetCode Problem 16 is titled ""3Sum Closest"". This is a classic problem in algorithm design and coding interviews, often used to test the understanding of two-pointer techniques and array manipulation.

**Problem Statement:**

Given an array `nums` of `n` integers and an integer `target`, you need to find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Problem Analysis:**

- You are given an array of integers and a target sum.
- The array may contain both positive and negative integers.
- The goal is not necessarily to find the exact sum that equals the target but rather to find a sum closest to the target.
- Only three integers from the array can be used to achieve this sum.
- It is guaranteed that there will be one unique solution for each input provided.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], target = 1
Output: 2
```
The closest sum to the target `1` from the provided array can be achieved by summing `[-1, 2, 1]` which equals `2`.

**Solution Rationale:**

The brute force approach would be to check every possible combination of three numbers in the array, calculate their sum, and compare the sums to the target. This would require three nested loops and thus would have a time complexity of O(n^3), which is not efficient, especially for large arrays.

A better approach is to use two-pointers after sorting the array:
1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.
2. Initialize a variable to track the closest sum found so far.
3. Use a loop to iterate over the array for the first element of the triplet.
4. For each element, set two pointers: one pointing at the next element, the other at the last element of the array.
5. Until the two pointers meet, do the following:
   - Calculate the sum of the three current elements.
   - Update the closest sum if the current sum is closer to the target.
   - If the current sum is equal to the target, return the sum (since it cannot get any closer).
   - If the current sum is less than the target, move the lower pointer up to increase the sum.
   - If the current sum is greater than the target, move the upper pointer down to decrease the sum.
6. Repeat the above steps for all elements.

By sorting the array, we can take advantage of the sorted order to move pointers in a directed manner to find sums that are closer to the target, thus optimizing our solution to run in O(n^2).

**Python Code Explanation:**

I will provide you with Python code that implements the aforementioned optimal strategy using the two-pointer technique. After presenting the code, I will break it down and explain each part."
17,"LeetCode problem number 17 is titled ""Letter Combinations of a Phone Number"". This problem is a classical example of backtracking and is usually classified under recursion or DFS (Depth First Search) category.

Here is the problem statement, followed by an extensive analysis:

**Problem Statement:**
Given a string containing digits from `2-9` inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.

A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

```
2: abc
3: def
4: ghi
5: jkl
6: mno
7: pqrs
8: tuv
9: wxyz
```

**Example:**

Input: digits = ""23""
Output: [""ad"",""ae"",""af"",""bd"",""be"",""bf"",""cd"",""ce"",""cf""]

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= digits.length <= 4`
- `digits[i]` is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
This problem requires us to generate all combinations of letters corresponding to a given string of digits, reminiscent of old mobile phone keypads where multiple letters are mapped to a single number.

Here are some important observations and nuances to consider:
1. The digits provided are non-zero.
2. The digits include `2` to `9`, as `1` and `0` are not mapped to any letters.
3. Any combination of letters must have the same length as the input digit string.
4. If the input is empty, we should return an empty list.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
The solution involves a recursive approach (backtracking) to explore all the possible combinations. Here is a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Map Digits to Letters:**
   Create a mapping from digits to their corresponding letters, similar to a phone keypad.

2. **Backtracking Function:**
   Implement a recursive backtracking function that takes the current combination of letters and the next digit to process.

3. **Appending Letters:**
   For the current digit, iterate over its mapped letters, append each letter to the current combination, and recursively call the backtracking function with the new combination and the next digit.

4. **Base Case:**
   The base case is when there are no more digits to process, in which case the current combination is a complete combination, and it can be added to the result list.

5. **Result List:**
   Start with an empty list to hold the combinations, and pass it to the backtracking function to be populated.

6. **Edge Case: Empty Input:**
   If the input is empty, simply return an empty list.

The algorithm's efficiency lies in the fact that it only generates valid combinations and avoids creating intermediate invalid combinations.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
Let's create a detailed Python code example step by step:

```python
def letterCombinations(digits):
    # Mapping from digits to letters
    phone_map = {
        '2': 'abc', '3': 'def', '4': 'ghi', '5': 'jkl',
        '6': 'mno', '7': 'pqrs', '8': 'tuv', '9': 'wxyz'
    }
    
    def backtrack(index, path):
        # If the path is the same length as digits, we have a complete combination
        if len(path) == len(digits):
            combinations.append("""".join(path))
            return
        
        # Get the letters that the current digit maps to, and loop through them
        possible_letters = phone_map[digits[index]]
        for letter in possible_letters:
            # Append the current letter to the path and proceed further
            backtrack(index + 1, path + [letter])
    
    # If the input is empty, return an empty list
    if not digits:
        return []
    
    # Initialize the result list
    combinations = []
    # Start backtracking
    backtrack(0, [])
    
    return combinations
```

In this code, `letterCombinations` is a function that takes a string of digits and returns all possible letter combinations. We use a helper method named `backtrack` that is defined inside the main function for modularity. The `phone_map` dictionary is used to map digits to corresponding letters. The `backtrack` function is a recursive method that constructs combinations using DFS.

The code initiates the backtracking process with the first index (0) and an empty path represented as a list. Instead of passing strings directly, we pass a list to the backtracking function for immutability and efficiency, converting it to a string upon adding to `combinations`. 

### Elaborate Examples
Consider the input `digits = ""23""`:

1. The backtracking starts with an empty path and index 0.
2. For digit '2', it has mapped letters 'a', 'b', 'c'. It goes through each letter and calls backtracking with index incremented by 1, and the path extended by the letter under consideration.
3. When index reaches the length of `digits`, it adds the current path as a complete combination to the result list.

The backtracking will generate all combinations like ""ad"", ""ae"", ""af"", ""bd"", ""be"", ""bf"", ""cd"", ""ce"", ""cf"".

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(4^N * N), where N is the length of the input `digits` string. The reasoning is that in the worst-case scenario each digit corresponds to 4 letters. Each recursive call we make, at maximum we explore 4 further calls. As a result, we have a tree with a branching factor of 4 and depth N, leading to O(4^N) combinations. Multiplying by N for the combination strings formation.
  
- Space Complexity: O(N), due to the recursion stack and path construction, where N is the length of the input `digits`. The space is linearly proportional to the recursion depth, which is the same as the input length.

### Real-World Applications
The problem of generating combinations is prevalent in scenarios where variations of configurations are necessary to be explored, such as:
- Generating permutations of security codes.
- Enumerating various possible DNA or protein sequences in bioinformatics.
- Forming different user inputs or commands from a set of symbols.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks
- Always make sure to handle the edge case of empty input by returning an empty list.
- It's important to work with either mutable states carefully or use immutable states like strings or tuples in the backtracking function to avoid unwanted side effects.
- Remember to use an efficient way to construct combinations; avoid using string concatenation in Python, as strings are immutable and can lead to unnecessary overhead; lists are preferable.
- Keep track of the current index within the digits string to avoid repeating combinations or missing out on any.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem follows the backtracking pattern, which is widely used to solve combination and permutation-based problems. Recognizing this pattern is crucial in solving similar problems where exploring all possibilities is required.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems
Here are some related LeetCode problems to practice backtracking and exploring combinations or permutations:

Each of these problems will further strengthen your understanding and application of the backtracking technique used for this problem.

By thoroughly breaking down the problem, coding an efficient solution, considering edge cases, performing complexity analysis, and understanding the real-world implications, one can gain a deep understanding of backtracking and its application in solving combination problems like this one."
18,"LeetCode Problem 18 is titled ""4Sum"". This problem is a classic example of a variation on the subset sum problem, which is known for its computational intensity as the problem size grows. Here's a detailed breakdown of the problem and its nuances:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The ""4Sum"" problem requires finding all unique quadruplets in an array which, when added together, sum up to a given target. A specification of uniqueness within the problem constrains us to find quadruplets such that each quadruplet must be distinct from the others based on the values of the elements in them, not the indices.

Here's a more formal statement of the problem:

**Given an array** `nums` **of** `n` **integers and an integer** `target`, **are there elements** `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` **in** `nums` **such that** `a + b + c + d = target`**? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of** `target`.

**Constraints:**
- The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.
- The array's length `n` will be in the range `[0, 200]`.
- Each element in the array can be any integer, positive or negative.
- The target sum is also any integer, positive or negative.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, you can apply the following strategies:

#### 1. Brute Force Approach (Naive Solution)

The most straightforward solution is to use four nested loops to try every possible quadruplet. However, this approach has a time complexity of `O(n^4)`, which is not efficient for larger inputs.

#### 2. Using Hashing (Efficiency Improvement)

This approach involves sorting the array and using a hash map to store the pairs of sums, leading to a time complexity of approximately `O(n^2)`. However, additional complexity arises from storing and checking for duplicates.

#### 3. Two-Pointers Technique (Optimized Solution)

This is the commonly accepted solution because it optimizes the search by reducing unnecessary iterations.

The strategy is as follows:
- First, sort the array. This allows us to skip over duplicate values and use the two-pointer technique effectively.
- For the first two numbers, iterate through the array with two nested loops, fixing two numbers as potential components of the quadruplet.
- Use a two-pointer approach for the remaining two numbers. Set two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the subarray that follows the second fixed number. Move the pointers based on whether the sum of the four numbers is less than or greater than the target.
- Skip duplicate elements to avoid counting the same quadruplet multiple times.

#### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's illustrate the two-pointer technique in Python:"
19,"LeetCode Problem #19 is titled ""Remove Nth Node From End of List."" Let's break down the problem statement, the solution strategies, and the Python code to solve this problem. We'll also provide examples, analyze time and space complexities, discuss real-world applications, highlight common pitfalls, and make connections to similar problems.

### Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of the list and return its head.

#### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is `sz`.
- `1 <= sz <= 30`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `1 <= n <= sz`

### Example

#### Input:
```
head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
```

#### Output:
```
[1,2,3,5]
```

#### Explanation:
The second node from the end of the list (the node with value 4) is removed, resulting in a new list [1,2,3,5].

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, we cannot simply iterate to the `n`-th element from the beginning since we need to remove an element from the end. A naive approach would be to first traverse the list to find its length `sz`, then traverse again to the `(sz - n)`-th element to remove it. However, there's a more efficient two-pointer technique known as the ""tortoise and hare"" strategy.

The idea is to maintain two pointers, `fast` and `slow`, where `fast` is `n` nodes ahead of `slow`. As we iterate through the list with both pointers, when `fast` reaches the end, `slow` will be right before the node we want to remove. This allows us to do the removal in one pass.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def removeNthFromEnd(head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
    dummy = ListNode(0)  # A dummy node to handle edge cases
    dummy.next = head
    slow = fast = dummy
    
    # Move fast ahead by n nodes
    for _ in range(n):
        fast = fast.next

    # Move both pointers until fast reaches the end
    while fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next

    # Remove the n-th node from the end
    slow.next = slow.next.next

    return dummy.next  # Return the head of the modified list
```

- `ListNode`: A class representing a node in the linked list.
- `removeNthFromEnd`: The function that removes the n-th node from the end.
- `dummy`: A dummy node is useful for handling edge cases, such as when we need to remove the head of the list.
- `slow` and `fast`: Two pointers initiated at `dummy`.
- The for-loop advances `fast` by `n` nodes.
- The while-loop advances `slow` and `fast` until `fast` reaches the end of the list.
- `slow.next = slow.next.next`: This operation removes the n-th node from the end.
- `return dummy.next`: Since the `dummy` node is always at the head of the list, `dummy.next` will be the new head after removal.

### Examples

- If `head = [1]` and `n = 1`, the output will be `[]` because the single node will be removed.
- If `head = [1,2]` and `n = 2`, the output will be `[2]` as the first node is removed.

### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity is `O(L)`, where `L` is the length of the linked list. This is because we traverse the list at most twice - once to advance `fast` and once to find the node to remove.

The space complexity is `O(1)` since we only use a fixed number of pointers regardless of the input size.

### Real-World Applications

Linked lists are used in many real-world applications such as:
- Undo functionality in software applications uses a stack which is a type of linked list.
- Image viewers often use linked lists to navigate through images.

### Common Pitfalls

- One common mistake is not handling the edge case where the head of the list needs to be removed. The dummy node prevents this issue.
- Another potential error is not considering when `n` is equal to the length of the list.

### Similar Problems

20,"LeetCode Problem #20 is titled ""Valid Parentheses"". This problem is a classic in computer science, often used to teach the concept of stacks. Here is a detailed analysis of the problem and how one might go about solving it in Python.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
The problem statement goes as such: given a string `s` containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

A string is considered valid if:
1. Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets are closed in the correct order.

It should be noted that an empty string is also considered valid.

There are a few nuances to consider in this problem:
- Matching pairs must be of the same type: '(' pairs with ')', '[' pairs with ']', and '{' pairs with '}'.
- Pairs must close in the appropriate order; for example, ""([)]"" is not valid because the brackets close out of order.
- It is not sufficient for there to be an equal number of open and closed brackets; they must be correctly paired.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
The most common and efficient way to solve this problem is to use a stack, which is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Here's how you can apply a stack to solve this problem:

1. Iterate over the input string.
2. Every time you encounter an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
3. When you encounter a closing bracket, it must match the bracket at the top of the stack; if it does, pop that bracket off.
4. If at any point you encounter a closing bracket that does not match the top of the stack, or if the stack is empty when you find a closing bracket, the string is invalid.
5. After the iteration, if the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket had a matching closing bracket in the correct order, and the string is valid. Otherwise, it's invalid.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
Here's how you might implement the above algorithm in Python:

```python
def isValid(s):
    stack = []
    mapping = {"")"": ""("", ""}"": ""{"", ""]"": ""[""}  # Mapping of closing to opening brackets.

    for char in s:
        if char in mapping:  # It's a closing bracket.
            top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'  # Use a dummy character if stack is empty.
            if mapping[char] != top_element:
                return False
        else:
            stack.append(char)  # It's an opening bracket.

    return not stack  # If stack is empty, all brackets were closed properly.
```

Here is the line-by-line breakdown:
- `stack = []` initializes the stack as an empty list.
- `mapping` is a dictionary that maps each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket.
- The `for` loop iterates through each character in the input string `s`.
- `if char in mapping:` checks if the character is one of the closing brackets.
- If it is a closing bracket, `top_element` is assigned the top of the stack if the stack is not empty; otherwise, we assign it a dummy character ('#'). This is to handle the edge case where the stack is empty when we find a closing bracket.
- `if mapping[char] != top_element:` checks if the top element on the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket of the current closing bracket, and if so, returns `False`.
- If the character is not in `mapping`, it's an opening bracket. In that case, we append it to the stack.
- At the end of the loop, the stack should be empty if all the brackets are properly closed and nested. Thus, `return not stack` will return `True` if the stack is empty and `False` if it's not.

### Elaborate Examples
Consider the following examples:
1. `s = ""()""` is valid because parentheses are correctly closed.
2. `s = ""()[]{}""` is valid because all types of brackets are closed in the correct order.
3. `s = ""(]""` is invalid because a square bracket is incorrectly closing a parenthesis.
4. `s = ""([)]""` is invalid because the order of the brackets is incorrect; a square bracket closes before a parenthesis does.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we traversed through each character in the string exactly once. The space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case (when all characters are opening brackets), as that would be the maximum size of the stack.

### Real-World Applications
This problem is a simplified model of various real-world scenarios such as:
- Syntax checking in programming languages where various types of parentheses must be balanced.
- Validating expressions in mathematical computations.
- Processing nested structures in data (e.g., XML or JSON parsing).

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks
Common pitfalls include:
- Forgetting to check if the stack is empty before popping (which could raise an exception).
- Not considering the case where the stack still contains elements after parsing the entire string.

A handy trick is to use a dictionary to map closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets, as it simplifies lookups.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem exemplifies the stack usage pattern where a stack is ideal for problems requiring elements to be processed in reverse order from which they are received.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems

- LeetCode #678: Valid Parenthesis String
- LeetCode #921: Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid

Each of these problems either extends on the concept of matching parentheses or requires the use of a stack to keep track of elements in a last-in, first-out manner. The skills learned in solving problem #20 are directly applicable to these related challenges."
21,"LeetCode problem number 21 refers to ""Merge Two Sorted Lists."" This problem is categorized under the linked list data structure and is commonly used to test understanding of manipulating linked list nodes and pointers in an interview setting. Here's a detailed breakdown of the problem:

## Problem Statement

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`. Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists, and you should return the head of the merged linked list.

### Constraints

- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Function Signature
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
```

## Solution Rationale

There are multiple approaches to solving this problem, including iterative and recursive methods. The key here is to maintain the sorting order while merging.

### Approach 1: Iterative Approach

1. Create a dummy node that will act as the starting point of the merged list.
2. Have a current pointer that points to the dummy node initially.
3. Compare the current nodes of both `list1` and `list2`.
4. Whichever node has the smaller value gets appended to the linked list being constructed by updating the current.next to point to it and moving the respective list head forward.
5. Continue this process until one of the lists is entirely processed.
6. Attach the remainder of the non-empty list to the end of the merged list.
7. Since the dummy node is the starting point, the actual head of the merged list will be `dummy.next`.

### Approach 2: Recursive Approach

1. Check if one of the lists is empty, return the non-empty list if that's the case.
2. Compare the head values of `list1` and `list2`.
3. Choose the node with the smaller value to continue with recursion.
4. The chosen node's next will be the result of a recursive call with the next of the chosen node and the other list node as parameters.
5. Ultimately return the node that had the smaller value.

Both approaches essentially make use of the fact that the lists are sorted, thus at any step, only the heads of the lists need to be compared.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation

Here we will go with the iterative approach. The recursive approach can be efficient as well but requires a more in-depth understanding of recursion and stack memory usage, which can lead to a stack overflow error for very long lists in different programming languages or in systems with a limited stack memory (not typically an issue for the constraints of this problem).

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        current = dummy
        
        while list1 and list2:
            if list1.val < list2.val:
                current.next = list1
                list1 = list1.next
            else:
                current.next = list2
                list2 = list2.next
            current = current.next
        
        if list1:
            current.next = list1
        elif list2:
            current.next = list2
        
        return dummy.next
```

### Line-by-Line Explanation

- `dummy = ListNode(0)`: We create a dummy node that will act as the anchor point for the merged list.
- `current = dummy`: This is the tail of the merged list, starting at the dummy node.
- `while list1 and list2`: The loop continues as long as there are elements in both lists.
- `if list1.val < list2.val: current.next = list1`: If the current value in `list1` is smaller, attach `list1`'s node to `current` and move `list1` forward.
- `list1 = list1.next`: Moving `list1`'s head to the next node.
- `else: current.next = list2`: Otherwise, attach `list2`'s node to `current` and move `list2` forward.
- `list2 = list2.next`: Moving `list2`'s head to the next node.
- `current = current.next`: Move the `current` pointer to the next node in the merged list.
- After the loop, if either `list1` or `list2` still has elements, we attach that remaining part directly to `current.next`.
- `return dummy.next`: The `dummy` node was a placeholder; the start of the actual merged list is its `next` node.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the iterative solution is O(n + m), where n is the number of elements in `list1` and m is in `list2`. This is because in the worst case, we are processing each node exactly once.

The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any additional data structures that grow with input size; we are merely rearranging the existing nodes.

## Example

Let's use an example to illustrate this:
- `list1`: 1 -> 2 -> 4
- `list2`: 1 -> 3 -> 4

Result after merging:
- Merged: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4

## Real-World Applications
Merging sorted lists is a sub-problem in many real-world applications, such as:
- Merging sorted files or datasets in data processing workflows.
- Implementing merge sort algorithm, which is based on the concept of merging sorted sublists.
- Synchronizing sorted lists that represent sets, like merging timelines of events.

## Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Forgetting to handle the case when one list is empty.
- Not correctly handling the tail end of the merged list (when one list is longer than the other).
- Overcomplicating the merge step instead of taking advantage of the sorted property.

## Problem Pattern Identification

The problem is a classic example of the two-pointer technique, where you have pointers (in this case, references to the node) traversing two lists or arrays simultaneously.

22,"LeetCode Problem 22 is titled ""Generate Parentheses"". Here's an extensive breakdown of the problem:

## Problem Statement

Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

To be more precise, you need to generate all possible strings of length 2 * n, where 'n' is the number of pairs of parentheses, and each string must be a valid parentheses sequence.

For example,
If n = 3, the function should generate the following list:
```
[
  ""((()))"",
  ""(()())"",
  ""(())()"",
  ""()(())"",
  ""()()()""
]
```
Each combination must consist of n opening '(' parentheses and n closing ')' parentheses, and must be a valid parentheses expression.

## In-Depth Solution Rationale

The problem of generating well-formed parentheses sequences is a classic example of a recursive problem that can also be approached using backtracking.

### Recursive Approach:
1. Each recursive call is responsible for placing either an opening '(' or a closing ')' parenthesis.
2. The base case is when the number of placed opening and closing parentheses both equal n. At this point, a well-formed parentheses sequence has been generated, and it can be added to the results.
3. The recursive calls must maintain the property of placing a closing parenthesis only if there are opening ones that have not been closed yet.

### Backtracking Approach:
1. Similar to the recursive approach, we try to extend the current parentheses sequence by adding either an opening or a closing parenthesis, with the goal of constructing a valid sequence.
2. We keep track of the number of opening and closing parentheses placed so far.
3. If the number of opening parentheses is less than `n`, we can put an additional `'('`. If the number of closing parentheses is less than the number of opening parentheses, we can put an additional `')'`.
4. On reaching a length of 2 * n, we found a valid combination, so we add it to the answer list.

The critical part of the backtracking approach is knowing when to add an opening or closing parenthesis. We must ensure that at no point do we add a closing parenthesis if there aren’t enough opening parentheses to match it—this would lead to an invalid sequence.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation

Here's how we can implement the backtracking approach in Python:

```python
def generateParenthesis(n):
    def backtrack(S='', left=0, right=0):
        if len(S) == 2 * n:
            # The parentheses string is complete.
            ans.append(S)
            return
        if left < n:
            # We can place an opening parenthesis.
            backtrack(S + '(', left+1, right)
        if right < left:
            # We can place a closing parenthesis.
            backtrack(S + ')', left, right+1)

    ans = []
    backtrack()
    return ans
```

Let's break it down:

- `generateParenthesis` is the main function that a user calls with the number of pairs `n`.
- Inside `generateParenthesis`, we define a nested helper function `backtrack`, which takes three parameters: `S` (the current string of parentheses), `left` (the current number of opening parentheses), and `right` (the current number of closing parentheses).
- We initialize our backtracking with an empty string and equal number of left and right parentheses (both set to 0).
- If `S` reaches the length of 2 * `n`, it means we have a complete well-formed parentheses string, so we add it to the answer list `ans`.
- We then check if we can add an opening parenthesis. We can do that if the number of left parentheses is less than `n`.
- Similarly, we can add a closing parenthesis if the number of right parentheses is less than the number of left parentheses, thus maintaining the validity of the sequence.
- `ans` list collects all the valid combinations that are generated via recursive backtracking.

## Elaborate Examples

Let's run through a couple of examples to illustrate how this works:

For `n = 2`, the call stack would look like:

```
backtrack(S='', left=0, right=0)
    -> backtrack(S='(', left=1, right=0)
        -> backtrack(S='((', left=2, right=0)
            -> backtrack(S='(()', left=2, right=1)
                -> backtrack(S='(())', left=2, right=2)  # Add to ans
        -> backtrack(S='()', left=1, right=1)
            -> backtrack(S='()(', left=2, right=1)
                -> backtrack(S='()()', left=2, right=2)  # Add to ans
```

The `ans` list would end up with `[""(())"", ""()()""]`.

## Thorough Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(4^n / sqrt(n)). It's the nth Catalan number, which arises naturally in various counting problems, like counting the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched. The proof for this lies in combinatorial mathematics.

- Space Complexity: O(n). Space is used to store the recursion stack. While generating one sequence, the maximum depth of the recursive call stack is n (not considering the space used to store the output itself).


## Real-World Applications

This problem has real-world significance in validating and generating expressions in programming languages, mathematical expressions, and sequences of nested structures (like JSON or XML), where the proper opening and closing of entities is crucial for the integrity of the data.

## Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- It's easy to mistakenly try to use a simple iterative approach, but correct generation requires recursive construction or a proper understanding of backtracking.
- One might also forget to enforce the rules that govern the valid placement of parentheses, thus generating invalid expressions.

## Problem Pattern Identification

This problem illustrates a combination of recursion, backtracking, and the generation of combinatorial objects – a common pattern for problems involving permutations, combinations, and bracketing.

23,"LeetCode Problem #23 is titled ""Merge k Sorted Lists."" Here is a detailed breakdown of the problem:

## Problem Statement

You are given an array of `k` linked-lists, lists, each of them is sorted in ascending order. Your task is to merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

### Input:

- An array of `k` linked-lists. Each linked-list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Output:

- A single linked-list sorted in non-decreasing order that is the result of merging all the `k` linked-lists.

### Example:

Given the following `k` linked-lists:

```
1 -> 4 -> 5,
1 -> 3 -> 4,
2 -> 6
```

The merged linked-list would be:

```
1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
```

### Constraints:

- `k == lists.length`
- `0 <= k <= 10^4`
- `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
- `-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`
- `lists[i]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, here are several approaches that you can take:

### Brute Force Approach:

1. Traverse all the linked-lists and collect the values of the nodes into an array.
2. Sort the array.
3. Create a new sorted linked-list by traversing the sorted array and creating nodes with the array values.

This approach is straightforward but not very efficient due to the cost of sorting the combined array.

### Priority Queue / Min-Heap Approach:

1. Initialize a min-heap (priority queue).
2. Add the first node of each linked-list to the min-heap.
3. While the min-heap is not empty, do the following:
    - Extract the smallest element from the heap.
    - Move to the next element in the linked-list of the extracted node and insert it into the min-heap if it is not null.
    - Add the extracted node to the merged list.

Using a priority queue allows efficient retrieval and insertion of the minimum element, thus maintaining the sorted order of the merged list.

### Merge with Divide and Conquer:

1. Pair up `k` lists and merge each pair.
2. After the first pairing, `k` lists are merged into `k/2` lists with average `2N/k` length; then `k/4`, `k/8`, etc.
3. Repeat this process until we get the final sorted linked-list.

This approach utilizes the fact that we are merging sorted linked-lists, which can be done in `O(n)` time where `n` is the total number of nodes in two lists.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation

We'll use the Priority Queue / Min-Heap approach to implement the solution in Python:

```python
from queue import PriorityQueue

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None

class Solution:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists):
        class Wrapper:
            def __init__(self, node):
                self.node = node
            def __lt__(self, other):
                return self.node.val < other.node.val
        
        head = point = ListNode(0)
        q = PriorityQueue()
        
        for l in lists:
            if l:
                q.put(Wrapper(l))
                
        while not q.empty():
            node = q.get().node
            point.next = node
            point = point.next
            if node.next:
                q.put(Wrapper(node.next))
        
        return head.next
```

Here's what's happening in this code:
- The `ListNode` class defines the structure of the nodes in the linked-list.
- The `mergeKLists` function is where the merging logic resides.
- A `Wrapper` class is created to wrap the nodes before putting them into the PriorityQueue because the PriorityQueue in Python cannot compare the nodes directly.
- We initialize a dummy node `head` and a pointer `point` to help us build the final merged linked-list.
- We initialize a PriorityQueue `q` and add the first node of each list into it.
- The `while` loop continues until the priority queue is empty.
- Inside the loop, we get the node with the smallest value, add it to our merged list, and then insert the next node from its linked-list into the queue if it exists.
- Finally, we return `head.next`, which is the start of our merged linked-list.

## Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: Let `N` be the total number of nodes across all `k` linked lists. The time complexity is `O(N * log(k))` where `k` is the number of linked lists. The comparison cost will be reduced to `O(log(k))` for every pop and insertion to priority queue. But finding the node with the smallest value just costs `O(1)` time.
- Space Complexity: `O(k)`, which is the space required to store the heap (priority queue).

## Real-World Applications

This problem can apply to any system that needs to merge multiple sorted streams, such as:

- Merging logs from different servers that are timestamped and need to be displayed in a single chronological order.
- Combining sorted data from different data sources, like database shards or partitions.

## Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Remember to check if the list is empty before adding it to the PriorityQueue.
- Use an appropriate data structure (like `Wrapper`) to enable comparison in the PriorityQueue.

## Problem Pattern Identification

This problem exemplifies the ""merge sorted structures"" pattern, which also underlies problems like merging two sorted arrays or the classic merge sort algorithm for arrays.

## Links to Similar Problems

Related LeetCode problems include:

- Problem 21: Merge Two Sorted Lists - a simpler version dealing with only two lists.
- Problem 88: Merge Sorted Array - instead of linked-lists, this deals with merging two sorted arrays.

In these problems, a key component is dealing with data already sorted and merging them efficiently, carefully handling pointers and/or indices according to the data structures involved."
24,"LeetCode Problem 24 is the ""Swap Nodes in Pairs"" problem. Here's an extensive breakdown and solution to the problem:

### Problem Statement

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed).

#### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`

#### Examples
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,1,4,3]
```

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

```
Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]
```

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The main challenge in this problem is handling the pointers in the linked list to swap the nodes in pairs. It is crucial to handle the edge cases such as lists with an odd number of nodes where the last node doesn't have a pair to swap with. Another edge case is an empty list or a list with only one node, in which the output should be the original list itself.

### Solution Strategy

A typical way to solve this problem is to use a pointer to traverse the list and swap the nodes iteratively. Because linked lists don't provide direct access to their elements, we must do this in-place. The main steps involved are:

1. Use a dummy node to simplify edge cases, which points to the head of the list. This allows us to handle the head being swapped without special cases.
2. Use a previous pointer to keep track of the last swapped pair's second node (which will be the first node after swapping). It starts as the dummy node.
3. For every two nodes, say `node1` and `node2`, we need to perform the following operations:
   - Point the `previous` node's `next` to `node2`.
   - Swap `node1` and `node2` by updating their `next` pointers.
   - Update the `previous` pointer to the current pair's new first node (which was `node2`).

We repeat these steps until there are no more pairs to swap or we reach the end of the list.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's write the Python code to implement the above strategy:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def swapPairs(head):
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = head
    prev = dummy

    while head and head.next:
        # Nodes to be swapped
        first = head
        second = head.next

        # Swapping
        prev.next = second
        first.next = second.next
        second.next = first

        # Reinitializing the head and prev node for the next swap
        prev = first
        head = first.next
    
    return dummy.next
```

Here’s a step-by-step explanation of the code above:

1. Define a `ListNode` class if it's not defined already by LeetCode.
2. Implement the `swapPairs` function, which takes `head` as its argument.
3. Create a `dummy` node with zero value, which points to the `head` of the list.
4. Initialize `prev` to point to the `dummy` node.
5. Enter a loop that continues until we reach the end of the list or there are no more pairs to swap:
   - Initialize `first` as `head`, the current node to swap.
   - Initialize `second` as `head.next`, the adjacent node to swap with.
   - Perform the swap by pointing `prev.next` to `second`.
   - Set `first.next` to `second.next` to link the first node to the next pair.
   - Link `second.next` to `first` to complete the swapping.
   - Move `prev` to `first` as it's now the beginning of the next pair.
   - Move `head` to `first.next` to proceed to the next pair of nodes.
6. Finally, return `dummy.next`, which is the new head of the swapped list.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's consider a linked list with multiple nodes:

```
Original list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
After swapping first pair: 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4
After swapping second pair: 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3
Final list: 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3
```

For an edge case:

```
Original list: 1
Final list: 1 (No swap is performed because there is only one node)
```

And for an empty list:

```
Original list: None
Final list: None (No swap is performed because the list is empty)
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

- **Time complexity:** The algorithm goes through the list exactly once, regardless of the size of the list, swapping the pairs as it goes. Since each node is visited once, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list.

- **Space complexity:** No extra space is used proportional to the input list size; only a fixed number of pointers are used. So, the space complexity is O(1) as we are swapping the nodes in place without utilizing any extra space for copies of the list.

### Real-World Applications

This problem represents a classical task of manipulating a data structure—in this case, linked lists. Linked lists are fundamental in computer science and are used in many applications where dynamic memory allocation is required. Techniques learned from this problem apply to manipulating sequence data structures, which includes not only programming but also reasoning about and visualizing pointer interactions.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- **Pitfall**: Forgetting to check for null (or `None` in Python) pointers when working with linked lists. For example, accessing `head.next` without ensuring `head` is not `None` could result in a `NullPointerException` or in Python a `AttributeError`.

- **Trick**: Using a dummy node greatly simplifies the edge cases such as swapping at the head of the list.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem follows a common linked list pattern called the ""pointer manipulation"" pattern. It requires good understanding and handling of pointers within a linked list structure, particularly when nodes are to be rearranged or swapped without changing their values.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems

Here are a few LeetCode problems that require similar techniques to solve them:

- Reverse Linked List (LeetCode Problem 206)
- Reverse Nodes in k-Group (LeetCode Problem 25)
- Remove Nth Node From End of List (LeetCode Problem 19)
- Rotate List (LeetCode Problem 61)

In each of these linked list problems, careful manipulation of node pointers is key to developing an efficient solution."
25,"LeetCode Problem 25 is called ""Reverse Nodes in k-Group"". This problem is a more complex variation of the classic linked list reversal problem, requiring a good understanding of linked list manipulation techniques. Let's breakdown the problem and discuss a detailed solution.

### Problem Description

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

We may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

### Constraints

1. The number of nodes in the list is in the range sz.
2. 1 <= sz <= 5000
3. 0 <= Node.val <= 1000
4. 1 <= k <= sz

### Input and Output Examples

**Example 1:**

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2  
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]

**Example 2:**

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3  
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]

### Explanation of the Solution

The general idea is to reverse every k nodes in the linked list. If there are fewer than k nodes left when reaching the end of the list (or initially if the list is shorter than k), we should leave them as is. This suggests that we need to handle two cases:
1. Reversing k nodes.
2. The case where the remaining nodes are fewer than k.

Here are the steps we would generally follow to solve the problem:

1. Count the number of nodes in the linked list (optional, can also be done on-the-fly).
2. Iterate the linked list reversing every k nodes:
    - Check if there are at least k nodes left to reverse. If not, return the list as it is.
    - Reverse the k nodes:
        - This involves standard linked list reversal procedures, but we need to handle pointers to connect the reversed k-group with the rest of the list.
    - Proceed to the next k-group.
3. Join all the k-groups that have been reversed.

### Python Code with Detailed Explanation

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def reverseKGroup(head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = head
    prev_group_end = dummy

    while True:
        kth = get_kth_node(prev_group_end, k)
        if not kth:
            break  # No more k groups to reverse.

        next_group_start = kth.next
        # Reverse the k nodes
        prev, curr = kth.next, prev_group_end.next
        while curr != next_group_start:
            temp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = temp

        # Connecting the current k-group with the previous part of the list
        temp = prev_group_end.next
        prev_group_end.next = kth
        prev_group_end = temp

    return dummy.next

def get_kth_node(node, k):
    while node and k > 0:
        node = node.next
        k -= 1
    return node
```

**Explanation:**
- The `reverseKGroup` function starts with creating a dummy node and setting its next pointer to the head of the list. This dummy node helps simplify edge case management, such as reversing the very first group.
- `prev_group_end` is a pointer to the node at the end of the last reversed group, initialized to the dummy node at first.
- We then enter a while loop that continues until there are less than k nodes to process.
- The `get_kth_node` function finds the k-th node from the current position. This is used to determine if there are enough nodes left to form a group that should be reversed.
- Inside the loop, we set `next_group_start` to `kth.next` to mark the beginning of the next group.
- The following lines perform the actual reversal of the current k-group.
- Finally, we adjust the pointers to reconnect the end of the last reversed group (`prev_group_end.next`) to the start of the reversed current group (`kth`), and set `prev_group_end` to the start node of the group we just reversed for use in the next iteration.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We potentially scan every node in the list, performing a constant amount of work for each node.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a fixed number of pointers and no extra space that scales with the size of the input.

### Real-World Applications

The concept of reversing elements in groups can be applied to various contexts like cryptography, data compression, or optimizing data storage where certain patterns are beneficial for performance or security.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Care must be taken to handle the pointers at the edges of each reversed group.
- Edge cases must be considered, such as when there are fewer than k nodes left, or the list is shorter than k from the beginning.
- It's essential to ensure the while loop correctly terminates when there are no more nodes to process.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem can be identified as a ""Linked List Manipulation"" problem, requiring in-place reversal of sub-portions (groups) of a linked list. Recognizing this pattern is important for solving similar problems involving linked list sub-structure manipulations, such as rotations, partitioning, or shuffling.

### Links to Similar Problems

Similar problems that involve linked list manipulation include:

Each of these problems utilizes similar node manipulation techniques and pointers handling skills that we discussed in this problem, though with different conditions and objectives."
26,"LeetCode Problem #26 is titled ""Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array"". The challenge is to remove duplicates from a sorted array in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length. You do not need to consider the elements beyond the new length.

Here's the problem statement for a detailed understanding:

Given a sorted array `nums`, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Clarification:
Confusion might occur because after function execution, it appears that the array still contains the duplicates (as you may print it or observe it in a debugger). However, the problem specifies that it's only the first part of the `nums` array that should contain the unique elements, up to the returned length.

### Example:
**Input:** nums = [1,1,2]
**Output:** 2, nums = [1,2,_]
The underscore indicates the irrelevant values which do not matter (they can be any value), since the question only cares about the elements before the new length (2 in this case).

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

The key to solving this problem is to use two pointers. Since the array is already sorted, duplicate elements are adjacent. We can have one pointer (`i`) for iterating over the array and another pointer (`j`) for keeping track of the position where the next unique element should be placed.

1. Initialize pointer `j` to `0`, which will be the index to insert the next unique element.
2. Iterate through the array with another pointer `i` starting from `1`.
3. Compare the current element `nums[i]` with the last unique element `nums[j]`.
4. If they are different, it means we found a new unique element; increment `j`, and then copy `nums[i]` to `nums[j]`.
5. If they are the same, skip `nums[i]` since it's a duplicate.
6. Continue this process until `i` has gone through the entire array.
7. The length of the array with unique elements will be `j + 1`.

### Python Code Explanation:

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    j = 0
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != nums[j]:
            j += 1
            nums[j] = nums[i]

    return j + 1
```

- We check if the array is empty first; if it is, we return 0 because there are no elements.
- We initialize the pointer `j` to 0 and point `i` to the second element in the array.
- In the for loop, we iterate from the second element to the end of the array.
- Inside the loop, we check if `nums[i]` is different from `nums[j]`. If it is, it means we found a unique element.
- We then increment `j` and update `nums[j]` with the value of `nums[i]` to store the unique element in place.
- After the loop finishes, `j + 1` is the new length of the array without duplicates.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because we pass through the array once with a single loop.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are only using existing space and not allocating any additional storage.

### Practical Applications:
Removing duplicates from a sorted list is a common task in many applications, such as:
- Database queries where you want to avoid duplicate records.
- Data pre-processing before applying machine learning algorithms.
- Managing sorted lists of user IDs, transaction IDs, etc., in back-end systems.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- Overlooking that the array is sorted, which is essential.
- Trying to create a new array or using extra space rather than modifying in-place.
- Forgetting to handle the edge case where the input array is empty.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem revolves around the ""two-pointer"" technique, often used in array manipulation, especially with sorted arrays. Recognizing such patterns helps to apply them to similar problems based on array transformation and in-place operations.

### Similar LeetCode Problems:

Each of these problems involves careful array manipulation, and the skills learned from solving ""Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array"" can be applied to these challenges. 

Understanding the nuances of array indexing and the efficiency of in-place operations is critical for solving these types of problems effectively."
27,"LeetCode Problem 27 ""Remove Element"" is an exercise in array manipulation. Given an array `nums` and a value `val`, the problem asks you to remove all instances of `val` in `nums` in-place, such that each element that is not `val` appears before any instance of `val` in the array. The relative order of the elements may be changed. You need to return the new length of the array after the removal.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
The problem is straightforward but requires care to handle in-place array modification. Key considerations are:

1. You must modify the array in place, which means you cannot use extra space for another array.
2. The relative order of elements can change, which hints at the possibility of swapping elements.
3. You have to return the new length of the array, which is the number of elements that are not equal to `val`.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
The most efficient way to solve this problem is to use two pointers: one for traversing the array (`i`) and one for keeping track of the ""new"" array's last index (`newLength`).

1. Initialize `newLength` to be 0.
2. Loop over the array with `i`.
3. If `nums[i]` is not equal to `val`, copy `nums[i]` to `nums[newLength]`, and increment `newLength`.
4. If `nums[i]` is equal to `val`, do nothing and continue to the next iteration.
5. After the loop ends, the first `newLength` elements of `nums` are the elements excluding `val`, and `newLength` is the new length of the array without `val`.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
```python
def removeElement(nums, val):
    newLength = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != val:
            nums[newLength] = nums[i]
            newLength += 1
    return newLength
```

- `removeElement` is a function that takes a list `nums` and an integer `val` as arguments.
- `newLength` keeps track of the new length of the array and the index where the next non-`val` element should be placed.
- The `for` loop iterates through each element in the array.
- Inside the loop, there's a conditional to check if the current element is not equal to `val`. If it isn't, we assign that element to the `nums[newLength]` index and increment `newLength`.
- If the condition is not met (meaning the element is equal to `val`), the loop just continues to the next element.
- After going through all elements, `newLength`, which is the count of non-`val` elements, is returned as the new length of the array.

### Elaborate Examples
Let's take a few examples:

1. `nums = [3, 2, 2, 3]`, `val = 3`. The function should rearrange `nums` to `[2, 2, _, _]` and return `newLength = 2`.
2. `nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2]`, `val = 2`. The function should rearrange `nums` to `[0, 1, 3, 0, 4, _, _, _]` and return `newLength = 5`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we traverse the entire array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), we are not using any extra space that is dependent on the input size; we modify the array in-place.

### Real-World Applications
This problem emulates real-world scenarios where data filtering is necessary. For instance, if an array represents a list of sensor readings and a specific value indicates a faulty reading, we may want to remove those values before processing the data.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks
Some common pitfalls:
- Forgetting to increment `newLength` after a non-`val` element assignment.
- Using an extra array accidentally, which would not comply with the in-place requirement.

A useful trick:
- Since the problem allows modifying the order of elements, you can optimize by swapping in elements from the end of the array if you want to preserve some elements and still modify the array in place.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem follows the ""two-pointers"" pattern, which is often used when modifying an array in place is required. The key is to use one pointer as an iterator and the other to modify the array.

28,"LeetCode problem number 28 is ""Implement strStr()"". The problem is essentially asking for the implementation of a function that replicates the behavior of the `strStr()` function in Java or the `index()` function in Python. Here's a detailed breakdown of the problem:

## Problem Description

Given two strings `haystack` and `needle`, the task is to return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

### Inputs:
- `haystack`: A string where we need to search for `needle`.
- `needle`: A string that we are searching for within `haystack`.

### Outputs:
- An integer representing the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not found.

### Examples:

- `haystack = ""hello"", needle = ""ll""` should return `2`.
- `haystack = ""aaaaa"", needle = ""bba""` should return `-1`.
- `haystack = """", needle = """"` should return `0`.

## Constraints:
- `0 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `haystack` and `needle` consist of only lower-case English characters.

## Solution Strategy

The solution to the problem can be approached in several ways:

1. **Brute Force (Linear Search):** Check every possible starting position of `needle` in `haystack`. For each possible starting position, check if the subsequent characters in `haystack` match `needle`.

2. **Two-pointers / Sliding Window:** Use two pointers to traverse over `haystack` with a window the size of `needle` and compare the window with `needle` at each step.

3. **KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) Algorithm:** This is an efficient string matching algorithm that preprocesses `needle` to create a ""partial match"" table (also known as ""failure function"") that is used to skip characters while matching.

4. **Rabin-Karp Algorithm:** A string-searching algorithm that uses hashing to find an exact match of a pattern string in a text. It hashes the pattern and the text's substrings of the same length and compares these hashes.

5. **Using Built-in Functions:** In Python, we could directly use the `find()` or `index()` string methods to search `needle` in `haystack`.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation

We’ll go with the most straightforward and less time-consuming method during implementation which is using Python's built-in function.

```python
def strStr(haystack, needle):
    # Return 0 if needle is an empty string
    if not needle:
        return 0
        
    # Use the find() method to locate the first occurrence of needle
    return haystack.find(needle)
```

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's walk through the examples mentioned in the problem statement:

- For `haystack = ""hello""` and `needle = ""ll""`, the function would execute `haystack.find(needle)` which returns `2`, because the substring ""ll"" starts at index 2 of ""hello"".

- For `haystack = ""aaaaa""` and `needle = ""bba""`, the function would return `-1`, because the substring ""bba"" is not present in ""aaaaa"".

- For `haystack = """"` and `needle = """"`, the function would return `0`, as an empty string is trivially found at the beginning of another empty string.

## Complexity Analysis

Since we are using Python's built-in `find()` function:

Time complexity: `O(n * m)`, where `n` is the length of `haystack` and `m` is the length of `needle`. In the worst case, we might need to check each substring of `haystack` that is of length `m`.

Space complexity: `O(1)`, since we are not using any additional data structures that grow with input size, and the `find()` operation is done in-place.

## Real-World Applications

The `strStr()` function is a basic operation in text processing and manipulation. It’s used in various applications like text editors, search algorithms, and string manipulation Libraries.

## Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- One common pitfall is not handling the case where `needle` is an empty string correctly. According to the problem, the function should return `0` in such a case.

- Another potential error is not accounting for the possibility that `needle` might be longer than `haystack`, in which case it cannot possibly be a substring, and the function should return `-1`.

## Problem Pattern Identification

This problem falls under the category of string manipulation and string searching algorithms, which is a common category in algorithm problems. Recognizing the pattern helps in solving similar problems such as finding substrings, matching patterns etc.

## Related LeetCode Problems

29,"LeetCode Problem 29 is titled ""Divide Two Integers"". The problem statement is as follows:

Given two integers `dividend` and `divisor`, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

Return the quotient after dividing `dividend` by `divisor`.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, `truncate(8.345)` = 8 and `truncate(-2.7335)` = -2.

The problem also states that if the division of two integers results in a quotient that is outside the 32-bit signed integer range `[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]`, then you need to return `2^31 - 1`.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The problem requires you to perform integer division, which is the process of dividing one integer by another and truncating the result to an integer. However, you must do this without using the obvious `*`, `/` and `%` operators that Python and many other programming languages provide for multiplication, division, and modulo operations, respectively.

Here are some subtle nuances and constraints of the problem:
- The result should be truncated, meaning that any decimal digits are discarded.
- The result needs to behave the same way for both positive and negative numbers.
- If the `dividend` is `0`, the result is `0`.
- The division result can overflow if the calculation exceeds the 32-bit signed integer range. In such cases, you need to clamp the result to the maximum integer limit which is `2^31 - 1`.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, we need to find another way to ""simulate"" division. One common approach is to use bit manipulation, specifically bitwise shifts.

- One way of thinking about division is as a series of subtractions. For example, the result of `10 / 2` can be found by subtracting `2` from `10` until what remains is less than `2`. The number of subtractions performed would be the quotient.

- This idea can be extended by considering the properties of binary numbers. Instead of subtracting the divisor once at a time, we can multiply the divisor by 2 (or any power of 2) by left shifting it (`<<`) and subtract larger chunks from the dividend. This is more efficient and can significantly reduce the iteration count.

Let's walk through an example with this approach:
Suppose we want to divide `dividend = 23` by `divisor = 4`. We would proceed as follows:

1. Start by finding the highest power of 2 such that `4 * (2^power) <= 23`.
2. Once that power is found, subtract the `4 * (2^power)` from `23` and add `2^power` to our quotient.
3. Repeat the process with the new, smaller dividend.

However, beware of possible negative numbers and the INT_MIN situation. The results of dividing `-2147483648` by `-1` will overflow the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's implement a Python function that follows this process:

```python
def divide(dividend, divisor):
    INT_MAX = 2**31 - 1
    INT_MIN = -2**31

    # Handle overflow scenarios
    if dividend == INT_MIN and divisor == -1:
        return INT_MAX
    
    # Get the sign of the result and convert both numbers to positive
    sign = -1 if (dividend < 0) ^ (divisor < 0) else 1
    dividend, divisor = abs(dividend), abs(divisor)
    
    # Perform the division using bit manipulation
    quotient = 0
    while dividend >= divisor:
        current_divisor, multiple = divisor, 1
        while dividend >= current_divisor:
            dividend -= current_divisor
            quotient += multiple
            current_divisor <<= 1
            multiple <<= 1
    
    # Apply the sign to the result
    return quotient * sign
```

### Elaborate Examples

```python
# Example 1:
input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
output: 3

# Example 2:
input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
output: -2

# Example 3 (edge case with INT_MIN):
input: dividend = -2147483648, divisor = -1
output: 2147483647 (INT_MAX due to clamping)

# Example 4 (another edge case):
input: dividend = 1, divisor = 1
output: 1
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: The main while loop runs in `O(log n)` time, where `n` is the dividend, since we are doubling the divisor each time. This is more efficient than simple iteration which would take `O(n)`.

Space Complexity: The space complexity is `O(1)` since we are only using a constant amount of extra space.

### Real-World Applications

The techniques used in this problem, such as bit manipulation and handling edge cases carefully, are applicable in various scenarios where resources are constrained, such as embedded systems or in the development of low-level programming languages where direct access to memory and performance is critical.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

Common pitfalls in this type of problem could include:
- Forgetting to handle the sign of the inputs correctly.
- Overlooking edge cases like the INT_MIN overflow.
- Not handling the case where `divisor` is larger than `dividend`, resulting in a quotient of `0`.

Tricks that could be used include:
- Using the XOR operator to determine the sign of the result.
- Being careful with left shifts to avoid overflow in the bit manipulation step.

### Problem Pattern Identification

30,"LeetCode Problem 30 is titled ""Substring with Concatenation of All Words"".

### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words` of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in `s` that is a concatenation of each word in `words` exactly once, and without any intervening characters.

### Input
- s: A string where 0 <= `s.length` <= 10,000
- words: An array of strings where 1 <= `words.length` <= 5000 and 1 <= `words[i].length` <= 30

### Output
Return all starting indices in `s` where such concatenation substrings start. The indices must be in sorted order.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
The challenge here is to identify all substrings in `s` which are exactly made up by concatenating all the words from the `words` array, with each word used exactly once. This implies that:
- The order of words in the concatenation can be any.
- The concatenated substring must have a length equal to the total length of all words combined.
- Substrings must consist of the words in their entirety, with no partial words or additional characters.

Key points to consider are:
- Two or more words in the array `words` could be identical.
- Not all words need to appear in `s`.
- The starting indices should be in ascending order.
- Overlapping substrings that fit the criteria should each be listed.
- Since the words can be in any order, all permutations need to be taken into account, which adds complexity to the problem.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
A brute-force approach to this problem would involve generating all possible concatenations of the `words` array and then checking if each exists in `s`, recording the starting index where found. However, this would be extremely inefficient, given the potential number of permutations to check and the cost of the contains operation if done naïvely.

A more efficient approach relies on sliding window and hashing techniques:
1. Calculate the total length of all words combined, which will be the length of the required window in `s`.
2. Use a hashmap (Python dictionary) to count the occurrences of each word in `words`.
3. Slide a window of the calculated length across `s` and at each step:
   a. Divide the window into substrings of the word's length.
   b. Use another hashmap to count the occurrences of these substrings within the window.
   c. If the count matches the original hashmap for each word, record the starting index of the window.

The final algorithm would ensure that only relevant parts of `s` are checked and would avoid unnecessary computation that would come with the brute-force method.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
Let's implement the more efficient approach in Python:

```python
def findSubstring(s, words):
    if not s or not words:
        return []

    word_length = len(words[0])
    word_count = len(words)
    word_map = {}
    result = []

    # Build the word count hashmap
    for word in words:
        if word in word_map:
            word_map[word] += 1
        else:
            word_map[word] = 1

    # The total length of the window in s
    window_length = word_length * word_count

    # Start sliding the window
    for i in range(word_length):
        left = i
        temp_map = {}
        count = 0
        
        # Scan the string in steps of word length
        for j in range(i, len(s) - word_length + 1, word_length):
            word = s[j:j+word_length]
            # If the word is part of words
            if word in word_map:
                if word in temp_map:
                    temp_map[word] += 1
                else:
                    temp_map[word] = 1

                count += 1
                # If a word count exceeds its expected frequency, shift the window
                while temp_map[word] > word_map[word]:
                    temp_map[s[left:left+word_length]] -= 1
                    left += word_length
                    count -= 1

                # If count matches the word count, we found a solution
                if count == word_count:
                    result.append(left)
                    
                    # Shrink the window by one word to continue searching
                    temp_map[s[left:left+word_length]] -= 1
                    left += word_length
                    count -= 1
            else:
                temp_map.clear()
                count = 0
                left = j + word_length

    return result
```

Let's break this code down:
- We check if `s` or `words` are empty. If either is, there can be no valid substring, and we return an empty list.
- `word_length` and `word_count` store the length of each word and the number of words, respectively.
- `word_map` is our frequency map for the words in `words`.
- We calculate `window_length`, which is the length of the substring in `s` we are looking for.
- The outer loop starts from the beginning of `s` and iterates over it by the length of a single word to check for the concatenated substrings.
- `left` will mark the start of our sliding window, and `temp_map` will store the frequency of the words within the current window.
- The inner loop iterates from the current position `i` to the end of `s`, in steps of `word_length`.
- If a new valid word is found in `s` that is in `words`, we update `temp_map`.
- If a word's frequency gets exceeded, we move the `left` pointer to the right, effectively shrinking the window and updating the count.
- When `count` equals `word_count`, it means we have found a valid concatenation starting at `left`, which we add to `result`.

### Elaborate Examples
Let's consider an example:
```python
s = ""barfoothefoobarman""
words = [""foo"",""bar""]
# Expected output: [0, 9]
```

With `word_length = 3` and `window_length = 6`, we would slide our window across `s` and find matches starting at index `0` and index `9`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n * m * k), where `n` is the length of the string `s`, `m` is the number of words in `words`, and `k` is the length of each word. In the worst case, we are checking each sub-window of length m * k within the string `s`.
- Space Complexity: O(m), for the hashmap `word_map` that contains at most `m` elements from `words`, where `m` is the number of words. Additional space for `temp_map` is also needed, but it does not grow larger than `word_map`.

### Real-World Applications
The problem could resemble real-world situations where pattern recognition or searching for a specific sequence of items within a larger dataset is required, such as:
- Detecting plagiarism by searching for specific sequences of words within a text.
- Forensic analysis for finding digital footprints in datasets.
- Bioinformatics, particularly searching for patterns in DNA sequences where the “words” could be specific sequences of nucleotides.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks
Common pitfalls include not correctly handling duplicate words in `words` and not correctly adjusting the sliding window when a word frequency is exceeded. A useful trick is to process the string `s` in chunks of the word length to improve efficiency.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem is an instance of a sliding window combined with a hashmap for frequency counting. This pattern is often suitable for problems that require finding substrings or contiguous segments within a larger string or array that meet certain criteria.

31,"LeetCode problem number 31 is titled ""Next Permutation,"" and here's a detailed breakdown of the problem, followed by an in-depth explanation of the solution methods in Python.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The ""Next Permutation"" problem asks us to implement a function that modifies an array of integers by finding the next lexicographically greater permutation of the array's numbers. If such a permutation does not exist (the arrangement is the highest possible permutation), we should rearrange the array into its lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

A permutation of an array of numbers is an arrangement of its members into a new sequence or ordering. Lexicographical order is the generalization of the alphabetical order of the dictionaries to sequences of ordered elements or numbers.

Here are some examples to illustrate the concept:
- The next permutation of [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
- The next permutation of [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] is the highest possible permutation.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify the longest non-increasing suffix (i.e., a part of the array where elements from the end are in descending order). This suffix cannot generate a larger permutation by swapping any of its elements.
2. Look at the element just before the identified suffix (let's call it the pivot).
3. If the pivot does not exist (the entire array is non-increasing), simply reverse the whole array.
4. If the pivot exists, find the rightmost element in the suffix that is greater than the pivot (it will be the element just larger than the pivot).
5. Swap the pivot with that element.
6. Reverse the suffix to get the lowest possible order for the new prefix.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Let's write the Python code based on the rationale given above and explain it line by line:

```python
def nextPermutation(nums):
    if not nums or len(nums) <= 1:
        return  # No need to do anything for an empty array or array with only one element

    # Step 1: Identify the longest non-increasing suffix
    i = len(nums) - 1
    while i > 0 and nums[i - 1] >= nums[i]:
        i -= 1

    # If such a suffix does not exist, reverse the entire array (Step 3)

    # Step 5: Swap the pivot with this element
    nums[pivot], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[pivot]

    # Step 6: Reverse the suffix
    nums[i:] = reversed(nums[i:])

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 3]
nextPermutation(nums)
print(nums)  # Should print [1, 3, 2]
```

- We start by handling the edge cases where the array has zero or one element. In these cases, there's nothing to do.
- Then we find the longest non-increasing suffix by iterating backward from the end with a `while` loop.
- If we reach the start of the array while looking for the suffix (i.e., the entire array is non-increasing), we reverse it to transform it into the lowest permutation and exit the function early.
- We identify the pivot, which is the last increase in the array when observed from the end.
- We find the smallest number in the suffix greater than the pivot by iterating backward until the condition `nums[j] <= nums[pivot]` is false.
- We swap this rightmost larger element with the pivot.
- Finally, we reverse the suffix to make sure that after the pivot, the sequence is in the lowest possible order, completing the transformation to the next permutation.

### Elaborate Examples:
1. Given `nums = [1, 2, 3]`, pivot is `2`, swap with `3`, and the result is `[1, 3, 2]`.
2. Given `nums = [3, 2, 1]`, pivot does not exist; reverse the entire array to get `[1, 2, 3]`.
3. Given `nums = [1, 1, 5]`, pivot is `1` at index 1, swap with `5`, and after reversing the suffix `[1]`, the result is `[1, 5, 1]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(n) since we're scanning the list a few times but only in linear passes. The space complexity is O(1) because we modify the array in place without using extra space for another data structure."
32,"LeetCode problem number 32 is ""Longest Valid Parentheses."" Here's a detailed breakdown of this problem:

## Problem Statement

Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

### Input
- `s`: a string of '(' and ')' characters.

### Output
- Return the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

### Example
```
Input: s = ""(()""
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is ""()"".
```

## In-Depth Solution Rationale

This problem can be approached in several ways. The core challenge is to determine the longest sequence of parentheses that closes properly. Here are some of the common strategies:

1. **Brute Force Approach**: Check all possible substrings one by one to see if they are valid. This approach, however, would lead to a time complexity of O(n^3), which is not practical for larger input sizes.

2. **Using Stack**: A stack can be used to keep track of the indices of the characters. We use the stack to store the indices of the '(' characters and whenever we encounter a ')' character, we pop an element from the stack. If the stack becomes empty, it means a valid sequence has ended, and we can use the current index and the last index of invalid sequence to calculate the longest valid parentheses length. This approach has a time complexity of O(n).

3. **Dynamic Programming**: Create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest valid substring ending at index `i`. The tricky part is coming up with the recurrence relation to populate this array. The time complexity of this approach is also O(n).

4. **Using Two Counters**: Traverse the string twice, once from left to right and then from right to left, using two counters—one for '(' and one for ')'. This algorithm relies on the fact that a valid substring will have an equal number of '(' and ')' characters. This approach also has a time complexity of O(n).

Among these approaches, using a stack or dynamic programming would result in an efficient solution with a linear time complexity. Using two counters is often the most elegant and easy-to-understand method. Let's delve into the stack approach and dynamic programming because they are more commonly used for such problems.

### Using Stack

1. Initialize a stack and push -1 onto the stack, which serves as a base for the next valid substring.
2. Iterate through the string:
   - If the current character is '(', push its index onto the stack.
   - If the current character is ')', pop from the stack. If the stack is empty after the pop, push the current index onto the stack; otherwise, calculate the length of the current valid substring by subtracting the top element of the stack from the current index, and update the maximum length if necessary.

### Dynamic Programming

1. Create an array `dp` of the same length as the input string initialized with all zeros.
2. Iterate through the string starting from index 1:
   - If `s[i]` is ')':
     - If `s[i-1]` is '(', then `dp[i] = dp[i-2] + 2`.
     - Else if `s[i-1]` is ')' and `s[i - dp[i - 1] - 1]` is '(', then `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i - dp[i-1] - 2] + 2`.
3. The answer is the maximum value in `dp`.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's implement the dynamic programming approach in Python.

```python
def longestValidParentheses(s: str) -> int:
    if not s:
        return 0
    dp = [0] * len(s)
    max_length = 0
    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        if s[i] == ')':
            if s[i - 1] == '(':
                dp[i] = dp[i - 2] + 2 if i >= 2 else 2
            elif i - dp[i - 1] > 0 and s[i - dp[i - 1] - 1] == '(':
                dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (dp[i - dp[i - 1] - 2] if i - dp[i - 1] >= 2 else 0) + 2
            max_length = max(max_length, dp[i])
    return max_length
```

In the code snippet above:

- `dp` is an array where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring that ends at `i`.
- We initialize `max_length` to 0 to keep track of the longest valid substring found so far.
- We iterate through the string, starting with the second character because a valid substring requires at least two characters.
- Inside the loop:
  - If `s[i]` is `)`, we check the previous character.
  - If the previous character is `(`, it means we have found a pair, and we can add 2 to our current longest substring, plus any valid substring that ends right before the pair we just completed.
  - If the previous character is also `)`, we need to ensure that there is a corresponding opening `(` for this potential closing `)`. We also have to consider any valid substring inside these parentheses. This is done by checking `s[i - dp[i - 1] - 1]`.
  - We constantly update `max_length` with the maximum length found after each iteration.
  
## Complexity Analysis

- **Time complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. We iterate through the string once, and each operation inside the loop is O(1).
- **Space complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. We use an additional array `dp` of the same size as the input string.

## Example Demonstration

Let's execute this function with an example:

```python
s = ""(()())""
# Expected output: 6, because the entire string is a valid sequence of parentheses.
```

Running this example will help confirm the functionality of our implementation.

Real-World Applications: The problem of finding well-formed parentheses is analogous to many real-world scenarios requiring balanced or matching pairs, such as checking syntax in programming languages, expression evaluation, and ensuring correct nesting in document structures like HTML or LaTeX.

Common Pitfalls:
- Not accounting for an empty string or a string of length 1 (which cannot have a valid substring).
- Forgetting to initialize the stack with -1 or not checking if the stack is empty before popping.

Problem Pattern Identification: This problem represents a classic stack usage pattern for balancing and matching problems. Recognizing such patterns can help solve other LeetCode problems such as ""Valid Parentheses"" or ""Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid"".

Let's now run this code with the example given to ensure its correctness."
33,"LeetCode Problem #33 is the ""Search in Rotated Sorted Array"" problem. Let's break down the problem, analyze it in detail, provide a comprehensive solution rationale, and discuss the Python code, along with examples, complexity analysis, and real-world applications.

### Problem Statement

Suppose you are given an integer array nums sorted in ascending order, and an integer target. Assume that the array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand (i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

You must write a function to search `target` in `nums` and return the index where it is located. If not found, the function should return `-1`.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array, and your algorithm must have `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To achieve `O(log n)` complexity, we need to use a binary search approach. However, a regular binary search won't work directly because the array is rotated. 

The key idea is to identify whether the target lies in the rotated part or the sorted part of the array. Once we know which side it's on, we can apply binary search in that half.

Steps to solve this problem:

1. Identify the middle element of the array.
2. Determine which half of the array is sorted.
3. Check if the target is within the range of the sorted half.
   - If it is, perform binary search within this half.
   - If it is not, the target must be in the other half, which contains the rotation. We recursively or iteratively repeat the process on the other half.

### Python Code Explanation

```python
def search(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        
        # Check if the left side is sorted
        if nums[left] <= nums[mid]:
            # If the target is in the left side
            if nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]:
                right = mid - 1
            else: # The target is in the right side
                left = mid + 1
        # The right side is sorted
        else:
            # If the target is in the right side
            if nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]:
                left = mid + 1
            else: # The target is in the left side
                right = mid - 1
    
    return -1  # The target is not found
```

Let's break down this code:

- We initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to the start and end of the array.
- We begin a loop that continues as long as `left` does not surpass `right`.
- We calculate the midpoint with `mid = (left + right) // 2`.
- We check whether the middle element is the target. If so, we return the mid index.
- We determine which half is sorted by comparing `nums[left]` to `nums[mid]`.
- We then check whether the target is in the sorted half. If it is, we move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`; otherwise, we move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.
- If we complete the while loop without finding the target, we return `-1`.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's consider the array `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` and target `0`:

1. Left is `0`, right is `6`, mid is `3`, `nums[mid]` is `7`.
2. Since `4 <= 7` (left half is sorted), but our target `0` is not between `4` and `7`, we look at the right half.
3. We update left to mid + 1, which is `4`.
4. Now, left is `4`, right is `6`, mid is `5`, `nums[mid]` is `1`.
5. Right half is sorted. `0` is between `0` and `2`, so we continue searching in the right half.
6. We update right to mid - 1, which is `4`.
7. Left and right both are `4`, mid is `4`, `nums[mid]` is `0` which is our target.

Return `4` as the index of the target.

### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: `O(log n)`, since we perform binary search.
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`, as we only use a few variables and do not use any additional space dependent on the input size.

### Real-World Applications

This problem can represent a situation in applications where a dataset is periodically updated and the most recent data is placed at the start.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Forgetting to check which part of the array is sorted.
- Not considering the corner cases when the target is equal to `nums[mid]`, `nums[left]`, or `nums[right]`.
- Modifying `left` and `right` incorrectly after identifying which side to search.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This is a variant of binary search in a partially sorted array with a pivot. It reinforces the idea of modifying binary search for complex scenarios.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems

- ""Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array"" (LeetCode #153)
- ""Search in Rotated Sorted Array II"" (LeetCode #81)
- ""Find Peak Element"" (LeetCode #162)

These problems require modifications to the standard binary search due to the sorted array being altered by rotation or having duplicates. The skill of identifying the sorted section of an array and applying binary search within it can be applied to these problems as well."
34,"LeetCode problem number 34 refers to ""Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array"", which is a classic binary search problem. Here is a detailed breakdown of the problem and a comprehensive analysis of its solution.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The problem statement is as follows:

Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given `target` value. If the target is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

Since the array is sorted and the requirement is for an `O(log n)` runtime complexity, this implies that we should be using a binary search algorithm. However, a typical binary search algorithm only finds one occurrence of the target value. We need to modify it to find the first and last positions of the target value.

**Solution Strategy:**

1. Perform a binary search to find any index of the target value (`mid`).
2. Once we find a `mid` index where `nums[mid] == target`, we need to find the leftmost and rightmost indices of the target value.
3. To find the leftmost index, we can apply binary search on the sub-array to the left of `mid` (i.e., from start to `mid - 1`) and keep updating our left boundary whenever we find the target.
4. To find the rightmost index, apply binary search on the sub-array to the right of `mid` (i.e., from `mid + 1` to end) and keep updating our right boundary whenever we find the target.
5. Return the leftmost and rightmost indices as the answer.

The reason for applying binary search separately for finding the leftmost and rightmost indices is to ensure that we are not simply stopping at the first instance of the target value we find. Instead, we explore the sorted array to find the boundaries of all occurrences of the target.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

```python
def searchRange(nums, target):
    def findLeft(nums, target):
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return left

    def findRight(nums, target):
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if nums[mid] <= target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return right
    
    left, right = findLeft(nums, target), findRight(nums, target)
    
    # Check if the target is not found
    if left > right:
        return [-1, -1]
    
    return [left, right]
```

**Code Breakdown:**

- `findLeft()` and `findRight()` are helper functions that implement binary search to find the leftmost and the rightmost index of the target, respectively.
- `findLeft()` searches for the first occurrence where the number is no smaller than the target, capturing the left boundary of the target numbers.
- Similarly, `findRight()` searches for the last occurrence where the number is the target or less, capturing the right boundary.
- Notice that `findLeft()` and `findRight()` differ in their comparison: 
  - `findLeft()` uses `nums[mid] < target` to adjust the `left` and `right`.
  - `findRight()` uses `nums[mid] <= target` so that it keeps moving to the right even when it finds the target value.
- We check if `left` is greater than `right` to determine if the target was not found in the array.
- If the target is found, `left` and `right` will represent the first and last positions of the target value, which we return as a list.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's go through a few examples to illustrate how the solution works:

Example 1:
```
nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10]
target = 8
The expected answer is: [3, 4]
```
The flow is:
- Start with `findLeft()` to locate the first 8, in this case, index 3.
- Then, apply `findRight()` to find the last occurrence, which is index 4.
- The result is `[3, 4]`.

Example 2:
```
nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10]
target = 6
The expected answer is: [-1, -1]
```
The flow is:
- `findLeft()` would finish with `left` as index 2.
- `findRight()` would finish with `right` as index 1.
- Since `left > right`, the method returns `[-1, -1]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: The algorithm runs in `O(log n)` time because binary search is applied twice, each time halving the search space, therefore, keeping the logarithmic time complexity.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is `O(1)` because we only use a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

### Real-World Applications

This problem can be applied to any situation requiring a search for a range or an interval within a sorted dataset. Examples include finding time intervals in logs, price ranges in stock data, or even a range of pages where a term appears in a sorted index.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- It's easy to mistakenly return after finding a single instance of the target value instead of searching for the range.
- Incorrect handling of the boundaries may result in off-by-one errors; careful attention must be paid to the conditions within the while loops and the final return statements.
- Ensuring that binary search conditions appropriately deal with duplicates is a subtle detail that can cause bugs if overlooked.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem is a variant of binary search, a common pattern where the problem space is halved iteratively. Recognizing this pattern helps solve similar problems that require searching through a sorted dataset.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems

- [702. Search in a Sorted Array of Unknown Size](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-sorted-array-of-unknown-size/)

Each problem retains the essence of binary search but challenges you to adapt the technique to different conditions and requirements. The skills learned in solving one are transferrable to the others."
35,"LeetCode Problem 35 is titled ""Search Insert Position."" Let's break down the problem:

### Problem Statement:
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

The problem specifies some conditions:
- The array consists of distinct integers.
- The array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Function Signature:
```python
def searchInsert(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
```

### Input:
- `nums`: An array of integers sorted in ascending order (non-decreasing).
- `target`: An integer target value to search for or to find the insert position of.

### Output:
- An integer, which is the index of the target if it exists in the array, or the index where the target should be inserted.

### Examples:
```python
# Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2

# Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1

# Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4

# Example 4:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 0
Output: 0
```

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
The problem is an application of the binary search algorithm, as the input array is sorted. A binary search is preferable over linear search as it has a time complexity of O(log n) compared to O(n) for a linear search, where n is the number of elements in the array.

Here’s how a binary search would typically be implemented for this problem:
1. Define two pointers, `left` and `right`, where `left` is initialized to 0, and `right` is initialized to `len(nums) - 1`.
2. Perform a while loop where `left` <= `right`.
3. Compute the middle index `mid = (left + right) // 2`.
4. If `nums[mid]` equals the `target`, return `mid`.
5. If `nums[mid]` is less than the `target`, shift the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`; otherwise, shift the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`.
6. If the loop ends, the `target` is not found, and `left` will be the position where the target should be inserted. Return `left`.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
```python
def searchInsert(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return left
```

- `left` and `right` pointers define the bounds of the search space within the array.
- `mid` is determined by the average of `left` and `right`, which identifies the center element of the current search space.
- We compare the `target` with the middle element `nums[mid]`.
- Based on the comparison, we either return the middle index, or we narrow the search space.
- If `target` is not found, `left` would be the correct insert position, as it would be the smallest index greater than the `target`.

### Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(log n), as the search space is halved in each step.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as the algorithm uses constant extra space.

### Elaborate Examples:
Consider the following scenario:
```python
Input: nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], target = 7
```
Here's how the binary search progresses:
- Initial state: left = 0, right = 4, mid = 2
- nums[mid] = 6, target = 7 -> left = mid + 1 = 3
- new state: left = 3, right = 4, mid = 3
- nums[mid] = 8, target = 7 -> right = mid - 1 = 2
- Since left > right, loop ends.

The correct insertion position is at index 3.

### Real-World Applications:
This algorithm is not only used for search operations but is also fundamental for problems that require insertion into sorted data without the overhead of re-sorting the entire structure.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- Mismanaging the `left` and `right` pointers can lead to infinite loops or incorrect results.
- Always ensure that `left` is updated to `mid + 1` and `right` to `mid - 1`, not `mid` itself, to prevent infinite loops.
- When returning `left` at the end, it should not be incremented again — it already points to the correct insertion position.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem follows a classic binary search pattern and is a good example of slightly adjusting the binary search to not just find an element but also to find a suitable insertion position.

36,"LeetCode Problem 36 is titled ""Valid Sudoku"". This problem asks you to determine if a given 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of the problem and how to solve it in Python.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The game of Sudoku is played on a 9x9 grid divided into 9 smaller 3x3 subgrids. To solve a Sudoku puzzle, each row, column, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids must contain all of the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once. In the context of this problem, the validation criteria are:

1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3x3 subgrids must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Additionally:
- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid according to the above rules, but it is not necessarily solvable.
- The board that you receive could include the character '.' as a placeholder for empty cells, which can be ignored during validation.
- The input is a list of lists where each sublist represents a row in the Sudoku board.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

A good approach to solving this problem is to perform three checks:
- Check each row for duplicates.
- Check each column for duplicates.
- Check each of the nine 3x3 subgrids for duplicates.

To do this efficiently, you may use hash sets to track the numbers seen in each row, column, and subgrid. As you iterate through the board, you will check if the current number has already been seen in the current row, column, or subgrid. If it has, the Sudoku board is not valid.

For the subgrids, you can calculate the index of the subgrid using the formula:
```
subgrid_index = (row // 3) * 3 + (col // 3)
```
This formula ensures that each 3x3 block gets a unique index from 0 to 8.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Python code to solve this problem:

```python
def isValidSudoku(board):
    rows = [set() for _ in range(9)]
    cols = [set() for _ in range(9)]
    subgrids = [set() for _ in range(9)]

    for row in range(9):
        for col in range(9):
            num = board[row][col]
            if num != '.':
                if num in rows[row] or num in cols[col] or num in subgrids[(row // 3) * 3 + col // 3]:
                    return False
                rows[row].add(num)
                cols[col].add(num)
                subgrids[(row // 3) * 3 + col // 3].add(num)
    return True
```

- `rows`, `cols`, and `subgrids` are lists of sets where each set will hold unique numbers for each row, column, and subgrid, respectively.

- The two nested loops iterate over each cell in the board.

- `num` is the value in the current cell.

- If `num` is not '.', meaning the cell is not empty, we check for duplicates by looking in the respective sets.

- If a duplicate is found (the number is already in a set), `return False` immediately, indicating that the board is invalid.

- If not, the number is added to the respective sets for the row, column, and subgrid.

- After checking all cells, if no duplicates are found, `return True` indicating that the board is valid.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's consider an example board:

```python
board = [
    [""5"", ""3"", ""."", ""."", ""7"", ""."", ""."", ""."", "".""],
    [""6"", ""."", ""."", ""1"", ""9"", ""5"", ""."", ""."", "".""],
    [""."", ""9"", ""8"", ""."", ""."", ""."", ""."", ""6"", "".""],
    [""8"", ""."", ""."", ""."", ""6"", ""."", ""."", ""."", ""3""],
    [""4"", ""."", ""."", ""8"", ""."", ""3"", ""."", ""."", ""1""],
    [""7"", ""."", ""."", ""."", ""2"", ""."", ""."", ""."", ""6""],
    [""."", ""6"", ""."", ""."", ""."", ""."", ""2"", ""8"", "".""],
    [""."", ""."", ""."", ""4"", ""1"", ""9"", ""."", ""."", ""5""],
    [""."", ""."", ""."", ""."", ""8"", ""."", ""."", ""7"", ""9""]
]
```

Upon running the `isValidSudoku` function with this board, it will return `True` because there are no repeated numbers in any row, column, or subgrid.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

**Time Complexity**: O(1), since we process each of the 81 cells exactly once, and our operation is constant time. Though it may seem like O(n^2) where n is the side length of the grid (9), since 9 is a constant, it simplifies to O(1).

**Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a fixed amount of space to create the sets for rows, columns, and subgrids irrespective of the input size.

### Real-World Applications:

Validating Sudoku puzzles is a straightforward application itself, but the principles used in this problem have broader applications such as:
- Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)
- Optimizations based on set operations or uniqueness constraints.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Remember to skip '.' characters which represent empty cells.
- Minor indexing errors, especially when calculating subgrid indices, can lead to incorrect results.
- Disregarding space complexity. Although the board size is constant, if it wasn’t, using too much extra space could be a concern.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This is a pattern of ""Set for Uniqueness Check"", often used in problems where you have to check for duplicates or maintain unique elements in a collection.

These problems involve using hash sets or maps to ensure uniqueness or to categorize data, and the skills from this Sudoku validation can be transferred to solve them efficiently."
37,"LeetCode Problem 37 is titled ""Sudoku Solver"". The problem is a classical example of a backtracking algorithm, where you are asked to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the ""Sudoku Solver"" problem:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

Sudoku is a logic-based combinatorial number-placement puzzle. Typically, the puzzle is presented on a 9×9 grid with some of the cells already filled with numbers from 1 to 9. The goal is to fill the remaining cells so that each row, each column, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called ""boxes"", ""blocks"", or ""regions"") contains all the numbers from 1 to 9.

The constraints for this problem are as follows:

- The given board contains only digits 1-9 and the '.' character, which symbolizes an empty cell.
- You can assume that there will be only one unique solution for each puzzle.

The problem gives you a partially filled grid and asks you to fill it in a way that respects the Sudoku rules.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, we will use the backtracking paradigm. Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique that considers searching every possible combination in order to solve a computational problem. The idea is to start with an empty cell and try filling it with the numbers 1 through 9 while adhering to the Sudoku rules. If at some point, a number placement leads to a conflict, the algorithm backtracks and tries another number.

Here's a step-by-step approach to the solution:

1. Find an empty cell in the Sudoku puzzle.
2. Attempt to place numbers 1-9 in that empty cell, one by one.
3. For each number placement, check if the current board still satisfies the Sudoku conditions. This involves checking the row, column, and the 3x3 subgrid the number is placed in.
4. If the placement is valid, recursively attempt to fill the next empty cell using the same approach.
5. If at any step, no number can be placed in an empty cell without violating the Sudoku rules, backtrack and change the previous placed numbers.
6. Continue this process until the board is filled completely, which would be the solution to the puzzle.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

The Python code will need to implement the backtracking strategy. Alternatively, this problem can also be approached by other methods such as constraint propagation and search.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of a backtracking-based Python code to solve this problem:

```python
def solveSudoku(board):
    def isValid(row, col, num):
        for i in range(9):
            if board[row][i] == num or board[i][col] == num or \
               board[3 * (row // 3) + i // 3][3 * (col // 3) + i % 3] == num:
                return False
        return True
    
    def solve():
        for i in range(9):
            for j in range(9):
                if board[i][j] == '.':
                    for num in map(str, range(1, 10)):
                        if isValid(i, j, num):
                            board[i][j] = num
                            if solve():
                                return True
                            board[i][j] = '.'
                    return False
        return True
    
    solve()
```

- `solveSudoku(board)`: This is the main function that will be called to solve the Sudoku.
- `isValid(row, col, num)`: A helper function that checks whether a given number can be placed at a particular row and column according to Sudoku rules.
  - It checks if the number `num` is already in the given row, column, or the corresponding 3x3 subgrid.
  - If the number violates the rules, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.
- `solve()`: This is a recursive function that implements the backtracking algorithm.
  - It iterates through each cell of the board and finds an empty cell (denoted by a '.').
  - Once it finds an empty cell, it tries to place the numbers 1-9 in it using a for-loop.
  - With each placement, it calls `isValid` to check if the placement is legal.
  - If `isValid` returns `True`, it recursively calls `solve()` to proceed with the next empty cells.
  - If at any point, no number can be placed, the function backtracks (undoing the last number placement by setting the cell back to '.') and tries the next number.
  - Eventually, if the fill-in process reaches a point where all cells are filled correctly, `solve()` will return `True`, indicating that the puzzle is solved.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's solve an example:

Given a board:
```
[
  [""5"",""3"",""."",""."",""7"",""."",""."",""."","".""],
  [""6"",""."",""."",""1"",""9"",""5"",""."",""."","".""],
  [""."",""9"",""8"",""."",""."",""."",""."",""6"","".""],
  [""8"",""."",""."",""."",""6"",""."",""."",""."",""3""],
  [""4"",""."",""."",""8"",""."",""3"",""."",""."",""1""],
  [""7"",""."",""."",""."",""2"",""."",""."",""."",""6""],
  [""."",""6"",""."",""."",""."",""."",""2"",""8"","".""],
  [""."",""."",""."",""4"",""1"",""9"",""."",""."",""5""],
  [""."",""."",""."",""."",""8"",""."",""."",""7"",""9""]
]
```

The solver will start by finding the first empty cell at position (0, 2) (0-based index) and will try placing numbers 1 through 9 while checking for validity. Let's say it tries with the number 1 first and calls `isValid`. If placing 1 leads to a valid configuration, it will move on to the next empty cell; otherwise, it will try the number 2, and so on.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this solution is hard to define precisely due to the nature of backtracking—it largely depends on how filled the initial board is and the placement of the numbers. However, in the worst-case scenario, the algorithm may have to check every possible combination of numbers for each empty cell, leading to a time complexity that can be approximated as O(9^n), where n is the number of empty spaces in the Sudoku grid.

The space complexity is O(n) due to the function call stack during the recursion, which goes as deep as the number of empty spaces that need to be filled.

### Real-World Applications

Sudoku solvers like this one have real-world applications in solving complex constraints satisfaction problems which arise in areas like logistics, scheduling, assignment problems, and design configurations. Although Sudoku is a simplified and abstract version of these problems, the principles of backtracking and constraint satisfaction applied here are directly relevant to those areas.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

Some potential pitfalls in implementing such a backtracking solution are:
- Not correctly implementing the `isValid` function, such as not checking all the necessary conditions for row, column, and subgrid constraints.
- Failing to consider that a valid number placement at an early stage in the backtracking can lead to an insolvable situation later on (hence the need for backtracking).
- Overlooking the base case in the recursion that stops the process once the board is successfully filled.

A trick to slightly improve efficiency is pruning unnecessary checks early. For example, if you can determine that placing a certain number would immediately lead to a conflict, you can skip that number without further checks.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The ""Sudoku Solver"" problem fits into the backtracking problem-solving pattern. Recognizing that this problem requires exploring different combinations and that it's okay to ""undo"" moves and try new paths when a dead-end is reached will help in solving similar problems that can be resolved with backtracking.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems

Several other LeetCode problems utilize backtracking, such as:

- N-Queens (Problem 51): Place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
- Permutations (Problem 46): Given a collection of distinct integers, return all possible permutations.
- Combination Sum (Problem 39): Find all unique combinations in a set of candidate numbers that sum to a target number.

Each of these problems uses backtracking in a similar way, by exploring combinations and backtracking when a certain path doesn't lead to a solution. Understanding the solution to the ""Sudoku Solver"" problem will provide insight into tackling these related problems."
38,"LeetCode Problem 38 is titled ""Count and Say."" The problem is part of the ""String"" category and tests your ability to generate strings based on a simple counting mechanism. Here is the detailed breakdown:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem statement asks you to implement the ""count and say"" sequence, which is a sequence of integers generated iteratively using the following method:

1. Start with the number ""1"".
2. Describe the previous number to get the next one (i.e., read off the digits of the previous number, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit).

The ""reading"" or ""description"" of the numbers is what gives this sequence its name. For example, beginning with ""1"":

- The first term is 1.
- The second term is read off the first term as ""one 1"" or ""11"".
- The third term is read off the second term as ""two 1s"" or ""21"".
- The fourth term is read off the third term as ""one 2, then one 1"" or ""1211"".
- And so on...

The problem asks you to write a function to determine the \(n\)th term in this sequence.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, we adopt an iterative approach, where each term is constructed by analyzing the previous term. The steps can be broken down as follows:

1. Initialize the sequence with the starting digit, usually ""1"".
2. Loop through the required number of terms, starting from 2 up to \(n\).
3. Within each iteration, analyze the previous string, counting consecutive digits, and concatenating a new string to form the current term.
4. Update the previous string with the new term for the next iteration.
5. Once the loop ends, the last string generated is the answer to the problem.

This approach is straightforward but requires careful handling of string operations and counts.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Here's a breakdown of how the Python code might look:

```python
def countAndSay(n):
    if n == 1:
        return ""1""
    
    previous_term = ""1""
    
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        current_term = """"
        count = 1
        for j in range(1, len(previous_term)):
            if previous_term[j] == previous_term[j - 1]:
                count += 1
            else:
                current_term += str(count) + previous_term[j - 1]
                count = 1
        
        current_term += str(count) + previous_term[-1]
        previous_term = current_term
    
    return previous_term
```

- We first deal with the base case: if `n` is 1, we return ""1"" immediately, since that's the first term of the sequence.
- `previous_term` is initialized to ""1"" since that's the starting point.
- We create a loop to generate the terms up to `n`. We start the loop from 2 because we have already defined the first term.
- Inside the loop, we have a nested loop that scans through `previous_term` and constructs `current_term` by counting consecutive characters.
- The `count` variable keeps track of the number of times a digit appears consecutively. When we encounter a different digit, we append the count and the digit to `current_term` and reset `count` to 1.
- After the inner loop, we need to handle the last sequence of identical digits that the loop ends with, hence the line `current_term += str(count) + previous_term[-1]`.
- We update `previous_term` with the `current_term` at the end of each loop iteration, ready for the next term's construction.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's run through a few examples using the function `countAndSay`:

1. If `n = 1`, the output is ""1"".
2. If `n = 2`, we start with ""1"" and describe it as ""one 1"", hence the output is ""11"".
3. If `n = 3`, starting from the previous term ""11"", we describe it as ""two 1s"", hence the output is ""21"".

Continuing with these examples will illustrate the pattern that the code functions correctly.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

In terms of time complexity, the solution is not quite straightforward to analyze because with each iteration, the length of the string grows unpredictably according to the pattern. However, in the worst-case scenario, the length of the string can at most double for each term (which happens when you have alternating digits), so for `n` terms, the time complexity can be roughly estimated as O(\(m^n\)) where \(m\) is the maximum length that can occur (which is not easy to calculate).

The space complexity is O(m) where \(m\) is the length of the longest term generated in the sequence because only one term is stored at a time.

### Real-World Applications:

Although this problem appears abstract and mathematical, the concept of reading and processing sequences iteratively has applications in data compression (run-length encoding), biology (analyzing DNA sequences), and in the interpretation of run-length limited (RLL) codes which are used in data storage.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

A common pitfall in this problem could be errors in handling the string indices, which could lead to off-by-one errors. Efficiency is another concern since strings are immutable in Python, and concatenating to them repeatedly can lead to higher time complexity. To avoid inefficiency in concatenation, a StringBuilder-like approach using lists could be used and the `join()` method can be called at the end to concatenate all parts into a single string.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem falls into the category of ""Simulation"" and ""String Manipulation"". Recognizing this pattern can be helpful for solving other problems where you have to simulate a process step by step or manipulate strings based on specific rules.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:

Each of these problems requires you to manipulate strings or sequences in similar ways, including analyzing portions of a string or constructing new strings based on certain rules."
39,"LeetCode Problem number 39 is titled ""Combination Sum"". It is a classic backtracking problem that requires finding all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to the target. Each number in candidates can be used multiple times in the combination.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the problem:

### Problem Statement

Given an array of **distinct integers** `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return a list of all unique combinations of `candidates` where the chosen numbers sum to `target`. You may return the combinations in any order.

The **same** number may be chosen from `candidates` an **unlimited number of times**. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

It is guaranteed that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than `150` combinations for the given input.

#### Constraints

- `1 <= candidates.length <= 30`
- `1 <= candidates[i] <= 200`
- All elements of candidates are **distinct**.
- `1 <= target <= 500`

### Example

Input: `candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7`
Output: `[[2,2,3],[7]]`
Explanation: `2+2+3` and `7` sum to `7`.

### Subtleties of the Problem

- The same number can be used multiple times in the combinations.
- The output should not contain duplicate combinations.
- The order of combinations and the order of numbers within each combination does not matter.

### Solution Strategy

The solution to this problem involves using a backtracking technique to explore all possible combinations that sum up to the target value.

Here's an outline of the backtracking approach:

1. Sort the `candidates` array to optimize the backtracking process.
2. Create a helper function `backtrack` which takes the current combination of numbers (`combination`), the remaining target to achieve (`remaining`), and the current position in the `candidates` array (`start`).
3. If `remaining` is 0, a valid combination has been found; add a copy of `combination` to the results and return.
4. If `remaining` is negative, the current path has exceeded the target and should be abandoned.
5. Iterate over the candidates starting from `start` to avoid revisiting the same combination in different orders.
6. For each candidate, subtract it from `remaining` and recursively call `backtrack` with the updated parameters.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

I will now provide Python code for solving this problem. After that, I will meticulously explain each part of the code:

```python
def combinationSum(candidates, target):
    def backtrack(start, combination, remaining):
        if remaining == 0:
            # Found a valid combination
            results.append(list(combination))
            return
        elif remaining < 0:
            # Exceeded the target
            return
        
        for i in range(start, len(candidates)):
            # Include the number in the combination
            combination.append(candidates[i])
            # Continue exploring further with the updated remaining
            backtrack(i, combination, remaining - candidates[i])
            # Backtrack and remove the last number added
            combination.pop()
    
    results = []
    # Start the backtracking process from index 0, with an empty combination and the initial target
    backtrack(0, [], target)
    return results
```

Let's break down the code:

- `combinationSum` is the main function that takes `candidates` and `target` as inputs.
- Inside `combinationSum`, a nested function `backtrack` is defined which is a recursive function used to perform the backtracking.
- The `backtrack` function takes three parameters:
  - `start`: The index in `candidates` from where to start looking for potential numbers to include in the combination.
  - `combination`: The current combination of numbers being constructed.
  - `remaining`: The remaining sum required to reach the target.
- If `remaining` becomes 0, it means the current combination is valid, so a copy of it is appended to `results`.
- If `remaining` becomes negative, the current path is abandoned as it has exceeded the target.
- Within `backtrack`, a loop is used to iterate over the candidates, starting from `start` to avoid duplicates.
- Each candidate is considered by adding it to the current combination and calling `backtrack` recursively with the updated `remaining` subtracted by the candidate's value.
- After the recursive call, the last added candidate is removed (`combination.pop()`) to backtrack and explore other possibilities.
- The `results` list is used to store all valid combinations found during the process.
- The backtracking process is initiated by calling `backtrack(0, [], target)`.
- Finally, the `results` list is returned which contains all unique combinations that sum up to the `target`.

### Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity of this problem can be a bit tricky to analyze due to the nature of backtracking and the fact that the solution space is affected by the specific values of `candidates` and `target`.

- **Time Complexity**: The worst-case time complexity is O(N^(T/M+1)), where N is the number of candidates, T is the target value, and M is the minimal value among the candidates. This is because the recursion may go as deep as T/M levels and at each level, we may iterate through the N candidates.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(T/M) due to the depth of the recursion stack and the space needed to hold the intermediate combinations. If we consider the space required for the output, it could go up to O(N^(T/M+1)), as it depends on the number of valid combinations.

### Real-World Applications

Problems like ""Combination Sum"" can be applied to real-world situations where you need to find all possible ways to achieve a certain total with a given set of items or options. For example:

- Financial portfolio optimization, where you want to explore different combinations of investments to achieve a desired return.
- Resource allocation in project management, where you need to determine all feasible distributions of tasks among team members.
- Menu planning, when you want to use available ingredients in various combinations to reach a certain nutritional goal.

### Potential Errors and Avoidance Strategies

- Failing to include a base case in the recursive function, which could result in an infinite recursion.
- Not making a copy of the current combination before adding it to the result list, which could lead to incorrect results due to Python's reference handling of lists.
- Not considering the case where the remaining sum becomes negative, which could waste computational resources.

### Problem Pattern and Recognition

Recognizing that ""Combination Sum"" is a backtracking problem is crucial. Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions and abandons a candidate as soon as it is determined that this candidate cannot lead to a final solution.

### Related LeetCode Problems

- Combination Sum II (Problem 40) - Similar to Combination Sum, but the candidates may have duplicates and each number can be used once in the combination.
- Combination Sum III (Problem 216) - Find all possible combinations of `k` numbers that add up to a number `n`, given that only numbers from 1 to 9 can be used and each combination should be a unique set of numbers.
- Combination Sum IV (Problem 377) - Counts the number of possible combinations that add up to a target number.

Understanding the principles of backtracking demonstrated in this problem will arm you with the techniques required to tackle a wide array of combinatorial problems on LeetCode and in other algorithmic contexts."
40,"LeetCode problem number 40 is titled ""Combination Sum II"". The objective of this problem is to find all unique combinations in a collection of candidate numbers where the candidate numbers can only be used once in each combination, and the sum for each combination equals a target number. 

Here is the problem statement:

Given a collection of candidate numbers (`candidates`) and a target number (`target`), find all unique combinations in `candidates` where the candidate numbers sum to `target`.

Each number in `candidates` may only be used once in the combination.

Note:
- All numbers (including `target`) will be positive integers.
- The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Input:**
    - `candidates`: An array of positive integers.
    - `target`: A single positive integer.

2. **Output:**
    - A list of lists, where each inner list is a unique combination of numbers from the `candidates` array that adds up to the `target`.

3. **Unique Combinations**
    - Combinations that are a permutation of the same numbers are considered duplicates and should not be included in the output twice. For example, `[1, 7]` and `[7, 1]` are the same combination.

4. **Candidate Numbers Used Once**
    - Each number in the input can be used at most once in each combination.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, we will need to perform a backtracking algorithm.

- **Backtracking Approach:**
  
    1. **Sorting:** Begin by sorting `candidates` so that we can easily skip duplicate numbers and stop the recursion early if the sum exceeds the target.
    2. **Recursive Function:** Create a helper function that attempts to build combinations by adding candidates to a temporary list `path` and aggregating them into a final result if they add up to the target.
    3. **Handle Duplicates:** One aspect we will need to handle in our recursive function is duplicate combinations. Because each number in the candidates can be used only once and we want to avoid duplicate combinations, we must skip over duplicate numbers at each recursive level.
    4. **Early Stopping:** If at any point the sum of numbers in `path` exceeds the target, we stop further recursion along that path.

- **Combination Construction:**
    - We build our combinations by exploring each candidate, appending it to our current path, and then recursing to find the next number that can be added to the path. Each time a valid combination is found that equals the target, it is added to the result set.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Here's a Python function that implements this strategy:

```python
def combinationSum2(candidates, target):
    def backtrack(start, end, target, path):
        if target == 0:
            # A valid combination found
            result.append(path)
            return
        if target < 0:
            # Target exceeded, stop exploration
            return
        for i in range(start, end):
            # Skip duplicates
            if i > start and candidates[i] == candidates[i - 1]:
                continue
            # Include candidates[i] in the combination
            backtrack(i + 1, end, target - candidates[i], path + [candidates[i]])
    
    candidates.sort()  # Sort the array to handle duplicates and optimize
    result = []
    backtrack(0, len(candidates), target, [])
    return result
```

1. We define a helper function `backtrack` inside our main function to which we pass the index range (`start`, `end`), the remaining `target` value to reach, and the current `path` which represents the combination under construction.
2. If the remaining target is 0, we found a valid combination and append it to our `result` list.
3. If the target becomes negative, we've exceeded the target and should stop exploring this path.
4. We use a `for` loop to try to include each candidate in the combination, starting from `start` to `end - 1`.
5. We skip duplicates by checking if the current candidate is the same as the previous candidate. This is because we've already explored this path.
6. We perform the backtrack call which will try to include the next candidate in the updated path.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(2^N) in the worst case, where N is the number of candidates. In the backtracking process, each candidate has two options: either be included or not included in a combination. However, because we skip duplicates and use sorting to achieve early stopping, the actual time complexity will often be better than this worst-case scenario.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of candidates. This is because the depth of the recursion tree can go up to N in the worst case, and each recursive call adds a level to the system's call stack. Additionally, we have to consider the space used by the temporary list `path` and the space used for the sorted candidates.

### Real-World Applications

- Combination Sum II can model real-world problems where you need to find subsets from a set of items that meet certain criteria, without reusing the items. For example, this can represent a budgeting problem where each item has a cost and you want to find all the ways you can spend exactly a certain amount of money.
- It's also applicable in situations where order does not matter, and you have to consider each option once—like in some types of inventory management, resource allocation problems, or in creating certain types of schedules.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- **Sorting**: It's crucial to sort the input array first to simplify the process of skipping duplicates and optimizing the search.
- **Avoiding Duplicates**: Pay careful attention to skipping over duplicates in the recursive function to ensure unique combinations.
- **Immutable Lists**: When passing the current path to the recursive call, it's important to pass a copy (`path + [candidates[i]]`) to avoid modifying the same list across recursive calls.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem is a classic example of the **backtracking** algorithm, which is used to generate all possible combinations of a set. Recognizing the backtracking pattern is useful for solving a variety of problems involving permutations, combinations, and subset generation.

41,"LeetCode Problem 41 is titled ""First Missing Positive"". This problem falls under the category of array and it poses a unique challenge because it asks for an in-place algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses constant extra space. Here's a detailed breakdown of the problem:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem states that given an unsorted integer array `nums`, we are to find the smallest missing positive integer. In other words, we need to find the lowest positive integer that does not appear in the array. Here are some important nuances to consider:

- Positive integers start from 1, so the smallest missing positive integer can never be less than 1.
- There can be negative numbers and zeros in the array, but we're only concerned with the positive integers.
- In-place means we have to modify the original array without using additional space proportional to the input size (constant space is allowed).
- The length of the array `n` could be anything from 1 to 50000, and the integers within it could range from `Integer.MIN_VALUE` to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

The naive approach would be to sort the array and then scan it to find the first missing positive integer. However, sorting takes O(n log n) time, which does not meet the requirement.

A more clever approach leverages the observation that the first missing positive integer is in the range `[1, n+1]` where `n` is the size of the array. Why?

- If all numbers from `1` to `n` are present, then the answer is `n+1`.
- If any number from `1` to `n` is missing, that is our answer.

Here's the approach:

1. **Segregate positive numbers**: We first move all non-positive numbers (negative numbers and zeroes) to one side. However, since we aim for constant space, we cannot use any extra array for this segregation.

2. **Place each number in its 'rightful' position**: If we had an array with all integers from `1` to `n`, each integer `i` would ideally be in index `i-1`. The strategy is to traverse the array and whenever we find a positive integer `x` such that `1 <= x <= n`, we place it in index `x - 1`.

3. **Scan for the first place where the index doesn't match the value**: After reordering, we find the first index `i` where the value is not `i + 1`, and `i + 1` is our answer.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

```python
def firstMissingPositive(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Base case
    if 1 not in nums:
        return 1

    # Case when 1 is the answer
    if n == 1:
        return 2
    
    # Replace non-positive numbers and numbers larger than n with 1s
    for i in range(n):
        if nums[i] <= 0 or nums[i] > n:
            nums[i] = 1
            
    # Use index as a hash key and number sign as a presence detector
    for i in range(n):
        a = abs(nums[i])
        # If you meet number a in the array - change the sign of a-th element
        if a == n:
            # If it's `n`, use first element's sign as a replacement
            nums[0] = -abs(nums[0])
        else:
            # Otherwise, use the actual element's sign
            nums[a] = -abs(nums[a])
            
    # Now, the index of the first positive number is equal to first missing positive.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if nums[i] > 0:
            return i + 1
            
    # If no positive number was found, that means the array contains numbers from 1 to n
    if nums[0] > 0:
        return n + 1
        
    # Otherwise, n must be the first missing positive
    return n
```

Each line of the code contributes to the overall strategy:

- We first handle the base case where if `1` is missing, it's clearly the first positive missing.
- If the array size `n` is `1`, then the answer is either `1` (if `nums[0]` is not `1`) or `2` (if `nums[0]` is `1`).
- We eliminate negatives and numbers larger than `n` by replacing them with `1`, since they don't influence the result.
- We use array indices as ""hash keys"" to mark the presence of numbers by negating the value at that index.
- Finally, we scan through the array to find the first index with a positive number, which corresponds to the first missing positive integer.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's review some examples to ensure our solution works correctly:

1. `nums = [3, 4, -1, 1]`. After processing, it becomes `[1, -4, -1, -3]`. The first missing positive is `2`, which is the answer.
2. `nums = [1, 2, 0]`. After processing, it becomes `[-1, -2, 1]`. The first missing positive is `3`.
3. `nums = [7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`. After processing, it becomes `[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`. The first missing positive is `1`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of the solution is O(n) because we pass through the array a constant number of times, and each pass is linear in the size of the array.

The space complexity is O(1) because the manipulation occurs in place, and we don't use any extra space that is dependent on the size of the input.

### Real-World Applications:

This algorithm demonstrates techniques that can be used in situations where space is at a premium and you can't afford to use sorting or hashing data structures. For example, in embedded systems or performance-critical applications where memory usage is to be minimized.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

A common pitfall is neglecting to consider that the numbers could be larger than the size of the array which cannot contribute to the solution. The trick is to replace them with `1` to simplify the problem.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem teaches us to use array indices as hash keys and array values to store additional information (like presence or absence indicated by a positive or negative sign), which is a valuable pattern for many in-place algorithms.

42,"LeetCode Problem #42 is titled ""Trapping Rain Water"". This problem is a classic example of a two-pointer technique and is typically classified as a hard problem due to the need for spatial intuition and efficient computation. Let's break down the problem, delve into solution strategies, write Python code, analyze complexities, and cover the other aspects as requested.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
The problem statement goes like this: Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Here is an example of an elevation map and the water that's been trapped:

```
Elevation Map: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Trapped Water:  [0,0,1,0,1,2,1,0,0,1,0,0] (The numbers represent the units of trapped water at each index)
```

The elevation map array contains integers where each integer represents the height of a bar. After raining, water can be trapped between the bars if there's a taller bar on both the left and right sides. The goal is to calculate the total amount of trapped water.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
To solve this problem, we can employ several strategies. Here are a few common methods:

1. **Brute Force**: For each element in the array, we find the maximum level of water it can trap after the rain, which is equal to the minimum of maximum height of bars on both the left and right sides minus its own height.

2. **Dynamic Programming**: We preprocess and create two arrays that contain the maximum heights to the left and to the right for each bar. The trapped water at each bar will then be the minimum of these two maximum heights minus the height of the bar itself.

3. **Stack**: We use a stack to store the indices of the bars. We process every bar and if we find a bar longer than the bar at the top of the stack, it means we have found a boundary capable of trapping water. We calculate the trapped water and update the total.

4. **Two Pointers**: This method involves using two pointers, one starting from the beginning of the array and the other from the end. We move the pointers towards each other while maintaining two variables to store the maximum height encountered from both ends. The core idea is to move the pointer from the side with the smaller max height and calculate the trapped water along the way.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
We'll discuss the two-pointer approach because it offers the best time complexity and doesn't require additional space like the stack or dynamic programming methods.

Here's how the two-pointer method works in steps:

1. Initialize `left` pointer to 0 and `right` pointer to the last index.
2. While `left` < `right`:
   - Calculate the trapped water at the position pointed to by the pointer with the lesser height.
   - Update the maximum height seen from both ends if the current height is greater.
   - Move the pointer with the lesser height inwards.
3. After the pointers meet, we will have calculated all the trapped water.

Now, let's write the Python code for the two-pointer approach and explain each step."
43,"LeetCode Problem 43 is titled ""Multiply Strings,"" which asks to multiply two non-negative integers represented as strings. Here's an extensive breakdown of this problem, solution strategies, detailed Python code explanation, examples, complexity analysis, real-world applications, common pitfalls, tricks, and related problems.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The problem ""Multiply Strings"" asks you to take two strings `num1` and `num2` as non-negative integers and return their product, also as a string. The constraints of the problem specify that neither of the integer strings contains any leading zeroes, except for the number 0 itself. You cannot use any built-in BigInteger library or directly convert the input strings to integers to perform the multiplication.

Key aspects of the problem:
- Non-negative integers represented as strings without leading zeros.
- The need to implement multiplication algorithmically.
- Return the product as a string.
- Not using any direct string-to-integer conversion for the purpose of multiplication.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, we need to simulate the multiplication process manually, just like you would multiply numbers on paper, from right to left, multiplying each digit and taking care of carrying over.

#### Approach - Digit by Digit Multiplication
1. Start from the last digit of each string and multiply each digit from `num1` with each digit from `num2`.
2. The product of two digits will give us a two-digit number most of the time. The first digit (tens place) of this product may need to be added to the next multiplication operation as a carry.
3. Each multiplication contributes to a specific position in the final result. For indices `i` and `j` in `num1` and `num2` respectively, their product contributes to the indices `i + j` and `i + j + 1` in the result.
4. Once we have all the contributions accounted for, we can add them up, managing carry overflows.
5. Build the final product string from the result array by skipping leading zeros.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

```python
def multiply(num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
    if num1 == ""0"" or num2 == ""0"":  # If any number is 0, the result is 0
        return ""0""
        
    result = [0] * (len(num1) + len(num2))  # Initialize the result array
    
    # Reverse both strings to simulate the paper multiplication
    num1, num2 = num1[::-1], num2[::-1]  
    
    for i in range(len(num1)):
        for j in range(len(num2)):
            result[i + j] += int(num1[i]) * int(num2[j])
            result[i + j + 1] += result[i + j] // 10
            result[i + j] %= 10
            
    # Skip leading zeros and generate the final string
    while result[-1] == 0:
        result.pop()
    return ''.join(map(str, reversed(result)))

# Example usage:
print(multiply(""123"", ""456""))  # Output should be ""56088""
```

Here's the line-by-line breakdown:
- We handle the edge case where either `num1` or `num2` is `""0""` upfront to save time.
- We initialize an array `result` to store the interim results. The length of the array is the sum of lengths of `num1` and `num2`, which is the maximum possible length of the multiplication result.
- We reverse both `num1` and `num2` so that we can start multiplying digits from the least significant digit (like paper multiplication).
- We use two nested loops to iterate over each digit of `num1` and `num2`, perform the multiplication, and add to the `result` array.
- We take care of the tens place by adding it to the next index in the result array.
- We periodically trim `result` to ensure it represents a proper number.
- Finally, we convert `result` to a string, making sure to reverse it back to represent the correct order of digits.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's multiply ""123"" and ""456"" by paper method:
```plaintext
      1 2 3
x       4 5 6
-----------
      7 3 8  (6 * 123)
    6 1 5     (5 * 123, shift one position to the left)
  4 9 2       (4 * 123, shift two positions to the left)
-----------
  5 6 0 8 8
```

This paper multiplication method is exactly replicated by the algorithm described above.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n \times m)\), where \(n\) is the length of `num1` and \(m\) is the length of `num2`. This is because we have to iterate through every digit of `num1` for every digit of `num2` in the worst case.

The space complexity is \(O(n + m)\) due to the result array we're creating, which holds the maximum possible size of the multiplication result.

### Real-World Applications

Understanding this algorithm can be helpful in scenarios where you are working with very large numbers that cannot be handled by standard data types (e.g., when dealing with cryptography or high-precision calculations in scientific computations).

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Forgetting to handle the carry properly can easily lead to incorrect results.
- Missing out on leading zeros in the result can cause the final answer to be incorrect.
- Not considering the case where one of the inputs is ""0"" can lead to unnecessary computations.

### Problem Pattern Identification

44,"LeetCode Problem 44 corresponds to the ""Wildcard Matching"" problem. This is a classic problem of algorithm and dynamic programming, where the task is to determine if a given string matches a pattern that includes wildcard characters.

Here's the complete problem statement for ""Wildcard Matching"":

Given an input string (`s`) and a pattern (`p`), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for `'?'` and `'*'` where:

- `'?'` Matches any single character.
- `'*'` Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

The matching should cover the **entire input string** (not partial).

### Example 1:

```
Input: s = ""aa"", p = ""a""
Output: false
Explanation: ""a"" does not match the entire string ""aa"".
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: s = ""aa"", p = ""*""
Output: true
Explanation: '*' matches any sequence.
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: s = ""cb"", p = ""?a""
Output: false
Explanation: '?' matches 'c', but the second letter is 'a', which does not match 'b'.
```


### Constraints:

- `0 <= s.length, p.length <= 2000`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
- `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'?'` or `'*'`.

This problem can be approached in several ways, including recursion, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms. The complexity of the problem mainly arises from dealing with the `'*'` wildcard, which can represent any sequence of characters, including an empty sequence. This makes it necessary to consider multiple potential matches at the same time.

Let's go through an in-depth explanation of the various solution strategies:

1. **Recursion**: A naive recursive approach could be to try matching the string and pattern character by character. When a `'*'` is encountered in the pattern, the algorithm could branch out, trying to match zero or more characters of the string with the rest of the pattern.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: DP approaches are usually more efficient for this type of problem. The idea is to use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents whether the first `i` characters of the string match the first `j` characters of the pattern. The DP array is filled in based on whether the current characters match, and how the `'*'` and `'?'` wildcards should be handled.

3. **Greedy**: A greedy solution can be implemented by iterating over the strings and patterns while keeping track of the positions where a `'*'` occurs. If the remaining part of the pattern does not match, the algorithm backtracks to the last `'*'` and tries to match different sequences of characters.

4. **Iterative with Two Pointers**: Another solution could involve two pointers iterating over the string and the pattern, respectively. When a `'*'` is found, the algorithm remembers the location and tries to match the rest of the string and pattern. If a mismatch occurs later, the algorithm returns to the `'*'` and moves the pointer over the string forward by one.

These approaches will have different performances, with the greedy and the iterative two-pointer approach typically being faster than the recursive or brute-force methods.

The complexity analysis mainly focuses on time and space complexities:

- The DP approach has a time complexity of O(m*n) and a space complexity of O(m*n), where m is the length of the string 's' and n is the length of the pattern 'p'. Optimizations exist to reduce the space complexity to O(min(m,n)).

- For the greedy or the iterative approach, the time complexity is generally O(m*n), but it can be significantly less in practical scenarios, especially when there's a limited number of `'*'` characters in the pattern.

Each solution requires careful handling of the edge cases, such as patterns or strings being empty, patterns starting or ending with `'*'`, and multiple consecutive `'*'` characters in the pattern.

Furthermore, to avoid common pitfalls, one must ensure that the entire string is considered (per the problem statement) and correctly handle cases where a `'*'` appears at the end of the pattern.

If you are interested in seeing a specific approach implemented in Python, please let me know, and I can provide detailed code and explanations for that solution."
45,"LeetCode problem number 45 is titled ""Jump Game II."" This problem is classified under the Greedy algorithms section and here is the problem statement:

Given an array of non-negative integers `nums`, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array. Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position. Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps. You can assume that you can always reach the last index.

## Problem Breakdown

- **Input:** An array of non-negative integers `nums`.
- **Output:** The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index.
- **Constraints:** Given that `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4` and `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`, and it is guaranteed that you can always reach the last index.
- **Jump Rules:**
    - Initially, you are at the first index (position 0).
    - You can jump to any index within the bounds of the maximum jump length at your current position (i.e., if you are at `nums[i]`, you can jump to any index in the range `[i+1, i+nums[i]]`).
    - You need to reach the last index (position `nums.length - 1`).

This problem requires finding the most efficient way to reach the end of the array, which is well-suited to a greedy strategy. The greedy approach for jump games involves looking ahead and making the jump that offers the best progress towards the end of the array.

## Solution Rationale

A naive approach would be to use backtracking or dynamic programming to try every possible jump at each index, but this would result in a high time complexity and could easily exceed the time limit for large inputs.

Instead, the more efficient method is to use a greedy approach to process the array from left to right. We maintain a variable to keep track of the farthest we can reach at each step and another variable to remember the end of the current jump range. When we go beyond the current jump range, we know that a jump is required, and we update the jump range to the farthest we've seen so far.

## Python Code Explanation

Here's how you could write the Python code for this problem:

```python
def jump(nums):
    jumps = 0
    current_jump_end = 0
    farthest = 0
    
    # We iterate until the second to last index because once we reach
    # the last index, we don't need to jump anymore
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        # We update the farthest point we can reach
        farthest = max(farthest, i + nums[i])
        # If we have come to the end of the current jump, we must jump again
        if i == current_jump_end:
            jumps += 1
            current_jump_end = farthest
            
    return jumps
```

In this code:

- We initialize `jumps` as the counter for the minimum number of jumps, `current_jump_end` as the farthest point we can reach from the current set of jumps, and `farthest` as the farthest point we can reach from exploring all the points in the current jump range.
- We loop through the array, but we stop before the last element since no jump is needed once we reach the last index.
- At each iteration, `farthest` is updated to the max of its current value and the index plus the value at that index (how far we can jump from `i`).
- If the current index reaches the `current_jump_end`, we increase the `jumps` counter and set the `current_jump_end` to `farthest`.
- The loop continues until we have made enough jumps to reach the end of the array, and the function returns the number of jumps.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`. We traverse the list once, and at each step, we perform a constant number of operations.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), because we only use a constant amount of extra space for variables `jumps`, `current_jump_end`, and `farthest`.

## Real-World Applications

The Jump Game problem can be seen in applications such as pathfinding and optimizing routes, where each jump represents a step or decision point, and the goal is to find the most efficient way to reach the destination.

## Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Overcomplicating the solution by trying dynamic programming or backtracking approaches can lead to time limit exceeded (TLE) errors.
- Remember not to increment the `jumps` counter when you are able to reach the end without additional jumps.
- Make sure to update `farthest` before checking if `i` has reached `current_jump_end`.

## Problem Pattern Identification

The problem follows a greedy pattern, where local optimal choices aim to reach a global optimal solution. Recognizing when a greedy approach is applicable can be key to efficiently solving similar problems.

46,"LeetCode problem number 46 is titled ""Permutations."" This is a classic problem in computer science that focuses on generating all the possible permutations of a given array or sequence of numbers.

Here is the problem statement for your reference:

Given an array `nums` of distinct integers, return all the possible permutations. You can return the answer in any order.

Example:

Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`
Output: `[[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]]`

This problem falls under the category of ""backtracking,"" which is a form of recursion that involves building up a solution incrementally and abandoning solutions as soon as it is clear that they cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution. 

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, we will use a backtracking algorithm to generate all possible permutations of the given array. The general approach for backtracking problems is as follows:

1. Choose: Consider an element to include in your current permutation.
2. Explore: Recursively build permutations with the chosen element.
3. Un-choose: Backtrack and remove the element from the current permutation so that it can be considered for future permutations.

An essential part of this recursive approach is maintaining a ""current state"" that represents a partial solution.

### Python Code Explanation

To implement this in Python, we can follow these steps:

1. Create a helper function that takes the current state of the permutation, the list of numbers we are generating permutations for, and a list to store the results.
2. On each call, check if we have generated a complete permutation. If yes, add it to the result list.
3. If not, iterate over the elements of the array and selectively use each element in the permutation if it is not already included in the current state.

Now, let's implement this and explain the code step-by-step.

```python
def permute(nums):
    def backtrack(first = 0):
        # if all integers are used up
        if first == n:
            output.append(nums[:])
        for i in range(first, n):
            # place i-th integer first
            # in the current permutation
            nums[first], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[first]
            # use next integers to complete the permutations
            backtrack(first + 1)
            # backtrack
            nums[first], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[first]
   
    n = len(nums)
    output = []
    backtrack()
    return output
```

1. `permute` is the main function that receives the `nums` array.

2. `backtrack` is the helper function that is defined inside `permute`. It's a common practice in Python to define such utility functions within the scope of a parent function if they are not needed elsewhere.

3. `first` is the index of the first integer to consider for the current permutation. It defaults to 0.

4. In the helper function `backtrack`, we check if `first` is equal to `n` (the length of the array), which means we've filled up the current permutation to its full length. In that case, we add a copy of `nums` to `output`.

5. If the current permutation is not complete, we iterate over the array starting from index `first`. For each index `i`, we swap `nums[first]` and `nums[i]` to place the i-th integer at the first position of the current permutation, then we recursively call `backtrack` with `first + 1`.

6. We perform backtracking by swapping the numbers back to undo the change before the next iteration.

7. Finally, we return the `output` list containing all the permutations.

### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(n * n!) — because there are n! permutations to generate, and it takes O(n) time to output each one.
- Space Complexity: O(n) — to maintain the call stack for the recursion, which in the worst case will go n levels deep, where n is the number of integers to permute.

### Practical Applications

The problem of generating permutations has practical applications in domains such as:

- Generating all possible combinations of a set of options, such as passwords or DNA sequences.
- Solving puzzles and games such as Sudoku or combinatorial puzzles.
- Optimization problems where all potential solutions need to be examined.
- Generating test cases in software testing for exhaustive testing combinations of inputs.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Remember to make a copy of the list or array when adding it to the result since you'll be modifying the original list in subsequent iterations.
- Be mindful of the indices used when iterating and swapping elements.
- It's easy to overlook the need to backtrack, but it's crucial for resetting the state for the next set of permutations.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The backtracking pattern identified in this problem is applicable to many other problems in which we need to explore a set of possibilities that can be built incrementally.

### Related LeetCode Problems

In summary, the permutations problem is a fundamental problem for practicing recursive algorithms and backtracking techniques. It lays the groundwork for understanding how to approach a vast set of problems in which all possible solutions need to be explored."
47,"LeetCode Problem 47 is titled ""Permutations II"" and it asks for generating all possible unique permutations of a collection of numbers that may include duplicates.

Let me give you an extensive breakdown of this problem:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem provides a list of numbers that might contain duplicates and requires us to return all possible unique permutations. By ""unique,"" they mean that we should not include duplicate permutations in our result, even if the input list contains duplicate numbers.

#### Inputs:
- A list of integers `nums`, which may contain duplicates.

#### Outputs:
- A list of lists where each inner list is a unique permutation of the input list.

#### Constraints:
- The length of the input list `nums` is typically constrained as \(1 \leq \text{len(nums)} \leq 8\).
- The values of the integers in `nums` are typically constrained within specific limits, for example, \(-10 \leq \text{nums[i]} \leq 10\).

This problem is an extension of the classic ""Permutations"" problem, which assumes all elements in the input are distinct. When dealing with duplicates, a brute force method of generating all permutations followed by a uniqueness filter would result in inefficiency and hence a more subtle approach to eliminating duplicates during the permutation generation process is needed.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

There are multiple strategies to deal with generating unique permutations:

#### Approach 1: Backtracking with Sorting
1. **Sort the list**: By sorting, we ensure that duplicates are next to each other which makes it easier to skip over duplicates when generating permutations.
2. **Backtracking algorithm**: Use a backtracking function to generate permutations:
   - Maintain a `current` list that holds the current permutation being built.
   - Iterate through the elements of `nums`, adding each non-chosen element to `current` and recursively calling the backtracking function.
   - Use a `used` list to mark elements that have already been included in the current permutation.
   - To avoid duplicates, before adding a number to `current`, check if this number is the same as the previous and whether the previous was used. If the number is a duplicate and the previous duplicate was not used, this means we are attempting to create a duplicate permutation so we skip this choice.
3. **Capture solutions**: When the `current` list has the same length as `nums`, we've generated a complete permutation, which we add to our solution set.

#### Approach 2: Counter and Backtracking
1. **Counter**: Use a Counter (or a dictionary) to count occurrences of each number in `nums`. This allows us to know how many instances of each unique number are available for permutation generation.
2. **Backtracking algorithm**: Similar to Approach 1, but instead of a `used` list, decrement the count in the Counter for each number as it is used in the permutation, and increment back when backtracking.
3. **Capture solutions**: Like above, when a complete permutation is formed, add it to the solution set.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation (Approach 1):

Let's use the backtracking with sorting approach.

```python
from typing import List

def permuteUnique(nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    def backtrack(start=0):
        if start == len(nums):
            result.append(nums[:])
            return
        for i in range(start, len(nums)):
            # Skip duplicates
            if i != start and nums[i] == nums[start-1]:
                continue
            nums[start], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[start]  # Swap
            backtrack(start + 1)
            nums[start], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[start]  # Swap back
            
    nums.sort()  # Sort the array to handle duplicates
    result = []
    backtrack()
    return result
```

Let's unpack the above code:

- `permuteUnique` function accepts `nums`, which is the list we want to permute.
- The `backtrack` function is a nested helper function that generates permutations and appends them to `result`.
- We initiate backtracking through every index starting at `start` and swap elements at `start` and `i`. This effectively chooses `nums[i]` to be at position `start` in the permutation.
- The if condition `if i != start and nums[i] == nums[start-1]` checks for duplicates. Since `nums` is sorted, duplicates will be consecutive. We only skip if `i` is not the starting index (we haven't chosen an element for this position yet) and if the current element is equal to the previous.
- We swap twice: once before the recursive call (to include the current number in the permutation) and once after (to backtrack and undo the change).
- The base case of the recursion is `start == len(nums)`, which means we have a complete permutation of the same length as the input list.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's consider the input `[1, 1, 2]`.

- First, we sort the list to `[1, 1, 2]`.
- Starting with the first position, we try `1`, then second position we again have to choose between `1` and `2`. When picking the second `1`, our duplicate check skips it since it's the same as the first `1`.
- Once we generate permutations starting with `[1, 2, ...]`, we backtrack and try permutations starting with `[2, ...]`. Since `2` is distinct, we proceed without skipping.
- The result would be `[[1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1]]`.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n!)\), where \(n\) is the length of input list `nums`. Even though we are eliminating duplicates, we are still generating permutations, which inherently is a factorial time complexity process.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n!)\) for the output structure in the worst case, as that is the number of possible unique permutations. Additionally, \(O(n)\) for the depth of the recursion stack, making the total space complexity \(O(n! + n)\).

### Real-World Applications:

This algorithm can be used in cases where you need to enumerate possibilities while avoiding repetitions, such as in:
- Game development (e.g., all ways to distribute powers where powers might be duplicated)
- Cryptography for generating key permutations
- Generating test cases where inputs might have duplications but you want to consider all unique scenarios

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

One common pitfall is failing to properly avoid duplicates during the backtracking process, which can lead to an exponential increase in runtime due to redundant work.

A key trick in Approach 1 lies in the sorting step that ensures duplicates are next to each other, simplifying the logic required to skip over them. In the backtracking step, ensuring the swap back operation is critical to correctly reset the state for further exploration.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem demonstrates the use of backtracking to handle permutations and combinatorial problems, particularly when additional constraints are present (unique solutions in this case).

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:

- ""Permutations"" (LeetCode Problem 46) - A similar problem without the consideration of duplicates.
- ""Subsets II"" (LeetCode Problem 90) - A problem that also deals with unique combinations, but for subsets instead of permutations.
- ""Combination Sum II"" (LeetCode Problem 40) - Finding unique combinations that sum to a target with duplicates in the candidate list.
- ""Palindrome Permutation II"" (LeetCode Problem 267) - Generating all possible unique palindromic permutations.

In approaching similar problems, understanding how backtracking works and optimizing it to handle special conditions like duplicates holds the key to developing efficient and correct solutions."
48,"LeetCode Problem 48 is titled ""Rotate Image"" and it's categorized under the Array section. The problem statement is as follows:

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

### Problem Breakdown:

The task here is to rotate an n x n matrix 90 degrees to the right. The challenge also specifies that the rotation should be done in-place, meaning you should not use any extra space for another matrix. To visualize this, if you have the matrix:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

After rotating it 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix should become:

```
7 4 1
8 5 2
9 6 3
```

There are two patterns in the rotation:
1. The first row becomes the last column.
2. The second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.

### Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, we might be tempted to think about moving elements one by one, but that approach is complex and prone to mistakes. Instead, we will consider two steps to solve the problem in a more systematic way:

Step 1: Transpose the matrix. Transposition means reflecting the matrix over its main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right). After transposing, our example matrix would become:

```
1 4 7
2 5 8
3 6 9
```

Step 2: Reverse each row. After reversing each row of the transposed matrix, our example would look like:

```
7 4 1
8 5 2
9 6 3
```

This two-step process gives us the rotated matrix, as required.

### Python Code Explanation:

Let's translate the rationale into a Python function that implements the solution for the given problem:

```python
def rotate(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    
    # Transpose the matrix
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
    
    # Reverse each row
    for i in range(n):
        matrix[i].reverse()
```

In this code:
- We first calculate the length of the matrix (n), which is the size of one of the dimensions.
- The first nested `for` loop goes through each element of the upper triangle of the matrix (including the diagonal) and swaps it with its corresponding element in the lower triangle. This effectively transposes the matrix.
- In the second loop, we use the `reverse()` method to reverse each row of the matrix.

### Complexity Analysis:

The overall time complexity of the solution is O(n^2) because we have to visit each element in the matrix at least once to transpose it, and again to reverse each row.
The space complexity is O(1) since we perform the rotation in-place without utilizing any additional data structures that depend on the size of the matrix.

### Real-World Applications:

This problem can represent various real-world scenarios, such as image processing where rotation is a fundamental operation, or games where the board might need to be rotated, and in general, any situation that involves manipulation of two-dimensional grids.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

One common pitfall is trying to perform the rotation in a single pass without transposing the matrix first. This will lead to complex code and increased risk of bugs. It's better to think in layers and perform the operation step by step.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem falls under the pattern of matrix transformation problems, where understanding the geometric implications of matrix operations is crucial. Recognizing such patterns helps to devise clear and concise solutions for these types of problems.

49,"LeetCode Problem #49 is titled ""Group Anagrams."" Let me break down the problem, provide a detailed solution rationale, and explain the Python code for solving this problem. Following that, I will discuss the complexity analysis, real-world applications, common pitfalls, problem-solving patterns, and related problems.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
The problem statement for ""Group Anagrams"" is as follows:
Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. For `strs = [""eat"",""tea"",""tan"",""ate"",""nat"",""bat""]`, one possible grouping of anagrams could be `[[""bat""],[""nat"",""tan""],[""ate"",""eat"",""tea""]]`.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
In order to group anagrams, we need a way to identify which strings are anagrams of each other. A common approach is to sort the characters in each string. Anagrams will become identical strings after sorting, and thus can be grouped together.

Here is a step-by-step approach to solving the problem:
1. Initialize a dictionary to map sorted strings to groups of anagrams.
2. Iterate through each string in the provided list `strs`.
3. Sort the characters of the string to serve as a key.
4. Append the original string to the list corresponding to the sorted key within the dictionary.
5. After processing all strings, the dictionary will have grouped all anagrams together.
6. Extract and return the groups from the dictionary as the final answer.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
Let's write the Python code corresponding to the strategy described above:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def groupAnagrams(strs):
    anagrams = defaultdict(list)  # Initialize a dictionary mapping a sorted tuple to a list of strings.
    
    for s in strs:  # Iterate through each string in the provided list.
        sorted_s = tuple(sorted(s))  # Sort the characters and use it as a key.
        anagrams[sorted_s].append(s)  # Group the anagrams together.
    
    return list(anagrams.values())  # Convert the grouped anagrams to a list and return.
```

Explanation:
- `from collections import defaultdict`: We're importing `defaultdict` from the `collections` library. A defaultdict will automatically initialize an empty list for a new key, saving us the trouble of checking for the key's existence.
- `anagrams = defaultdict(list)`: We create a defaultdict that will store lists of anagram groups, keyed by a sorted tuple of characters.
- `for s in strs`: We begin iterating through the input list of strings.
- `sorted_s = tuple(sorted(s))`: Sorting the characters in the string `s` and converting them into a tuple gives us a sortable, hashable key for the dictionary.
- `anagrams[sorted_s].append(s)`: We append the original string `s` to the list of anagrams corresponding to the sorted key `sorted_s`.
- `return list(anagrams.values())`: We extract and return all anagram groups as a list of lists.

### Elaborate Examples
Using the provided input `[""eat"",""tea"",""tan"",""ate"",""nat"",""bat""]`, the function would work like this:
- ""eat"" gets sorted to ""aet"" and is placed in the group keyed with ""aet"".
- ""tea"" is also sorted to ""aet"" and goes to the same group as ""eat"".
- ""tan"" gets sorted to ""ant"" and starts a new group.
- ""ate"" gets sorted to ""aet"" and is added to the ""eat"" and ""tea"" group.
- ""nat"" gets sorted to ""ant"" and goes to the same group as ""tan"".
- ""bat"" gets sorted to ""abt"" and starts another new group.

Finally, we would have the anagram groups:
- ""aet"": [""eat"", ""tea"", ""ate""]
- ""ant"": [""tan"", ""nat""]
- ""abt"": [""bat""]

The function returns these groups as `[['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], ['tan', 'nat'], ['bat']]`. The order within each group and the order of the groups themselves does not matter.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
1. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity primarily consists of iterating through each string and sorting it. If `k` is the maximum length of a string in `strs`, and `n` is the number of strings, the time complexity to sort each string is O(k log k). Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n * k log k).
2. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity consists of the space used to store the groups of anagrams. In the worst case where there are no anagrams, the space complexity is O(n), as every string will be in its own group.

### Real-World Applications
Grouping anagrams has practical uses in word games, like Scrabble or Boggle, where players might want to identify words that can be formed from the same set of letters. It's also a common task in text-processing and cryptography.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks
A common pitfall is not realizing that the key used for grouping must be hashable; that's why we convert the sorted list to a tuple. Additionally, the sorting operation cannot be skipped, as it's crucial to identify anagrams.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem exemplifies the usage of a hash table (or dictionary in Python) to group items with a common feature. It's a pattern of categorizing items based on a derived key, which in this case is the sorted string.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems
Related LeetCode problems include:
- 242. Valid Anagram
- 438. Find All Anagrams in a String
- 884. Uncommon Words from Two Sentences

Each of these problems involves anagrams or similar categorization strategies where the solution involves hashing or sorting to efficiently compare elements based on certain criteria.

In conclusion, the ""Group Anagrams"" problem is a classic example of a categorization problem that is solved effectively using sorting and hashing strategies. By understanding the solution to this problem, you not only learn how to efficiently group anagrams but also gain insights into other algorithms and data structures such as sorting, hashing, and the usage of dictionaries."
50,"LeetCode problem number 50 is titled ""Pow(x, n)"", which asks you to implement the function `pow(x, n)`, which calculates `x` raised to the power of `n` (`x^n`).

Here's a detailed breakdown of the problem:

### Problem Statement

We need to implement the power function which receives two inputs: a floating-point number `x` and an integer `n`. The function should return the result of raising `x` to the power `n`, which is mathematically represented as `x^n`.

### Constraints

- `-100.0 < x < 100.0`: The base `x` is a floating point number within the range of -100 to 100.
- `-2^31 <= n <= 2^31-1`: The exponent `n` is an integer within the range of the 32-bit signed integer.
- The solution must handle all edge cases such as `n` being negative or zero.

### Solution Rationale

There are several ways to approach this problem, but two methods are commonly used due to their efficiency: the iterative and recursive approaches using the concept of ""Exponentiation by Squaring"".

1. **Exponential by Squaring (Recursive Approach)**: This approach leverages the fact that `x^n` can be split into `(x^(n/2)) * (x^(n/2))` if `n` is even, or `x * (x^((n-1)/2)) * (x^((n-1)/2))` if `n` is odd. The recursive calls continue to split the problem in half at each step until the base case is reached.

2. **Exponential by Squaring (Iterative Approach)**: This follows the same logic as the recursive approach but avoids the overhead of recursive calls by using a loop. This can be faster due to better utilization of memory and fewer function calls.

3. **Brute force** approach is to multiply `x` with itself `n` times, but it will be highly inefficient for large values of `n` and hence is not practical for this problem due to time complexity constraints.

The exponential by squaring method is preferred over brute force for its efficiency in time complexity. It reduces the complexity from O(n) to O(log n) where n is the exponent.

### Edge Cases

The implementation must handle cases where:
- `n` is negative: Calculate the power for positive `n` and take the reciprocal.
- `n` is zero: The result is always `1` regardless of `x`.
- `x` is zero or one: Return `x` since any number to zero power is `1` and one raised to any power remains `1`. 

### Python Code Explanation

Here's an example Python implementation using the recursive approach:

```python
# Recursive implementation of power function using exponentiation by squaring
def myPow(x: float, n: int) -> float:
    if n < 0:
        # Handle the case where n is negative
        x = 1 / x
        n = -n
    return fastPow(x, n)

def fastPow(x: float, n: int) -> float:
    if n == 0:
        # Base case: any number raised to the power of 0 is 1
        return 1.0
    half = fastPow(x, n // 2)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        # If n is even, multiply the results of half*half
        return half * half
    else:
        # If n is odd, multiply x with the results of half*half
        return x * half * half
```

In the above code:
- The `myPow` function takes care of negative exponents by taking the reciprocal of `x` and converting `n` into a positive exponent.
- The `fastPow` function is the recursive function that performs the actual computation.
- This function uses integer division (`//`) to halve `n` and the modulo operator (`%`) to check if `n` is even or odd.
- The base case of the recursion is when `n` is `0`, and by definition `x^0 = 1`.

### Examples

Let's run through a couple of examples to demonstrate the solution:

1. `myPow(2.00000, 10)` should return `1024.00000` because `2^10 = 1024`.
2. `myPow(2.10000, 3)` should return `9.26100` because `2.1^3 ≈ 9.261`.
3. `myPow(2.00000, -2)` should return `0.25000` because `2^-2 = 1/2^2 = 0.25`.

### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the recursive solution is O(log n) because with each recursive call, we halve the exponent until it reaches zero.

The space complexity is also O(log n) due to the recursive call stack. Even though the iterative approach eliminates the recursive call stack, the time complexity would still remain O(log n).

### Real-World Applications

The power function is widely used in numerous real-world applications such as scientific computing, financial modeling (compound interest calculations), computer graphics (scaling), and any other domain where exponentiation is needed.
"
51,"LeetCode Problem 51 is titled ""N-Queens"". This is a classic backtracking problem in which you are asked to find all distinct solutions to the N-Queens puzzle. The N-Queens puzzle is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NxN chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. That means no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
Here are some aspects of the problem:
- Given an integer N, representing the number of queens (which is also the size of the chessboard), you need to return all possible board configurations where the N queens do not attack each other.
- The output should be a list of lists. Each list represents one solution, and it contains strings with '.' (dots) representing an empty space on the board and 'Q' representing a queen.
- The order in which these solutions are returned does not matter.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
To approach this problem, we will use backtracking, a form of recursion where we explore all possible configurations and ""backtrack"" once we determine that the current path cannot lead to a solution.

Here's how we can go about implementing this:
1. **Select Column**: Start in the first row and try placing a queen in each column one by one.
2. **Validate**: After placing the queen, we need to check if the current placement leads to any conflict (if they attack each other). Queens attack if they are on the same row, same column, or the same diagonal.
3. **Recurse or Backtrack**: If no conflict occurs, we move to the next row and try to place another queen. If a conflict is detected, we remove the queen (backtrack) and try the next position in the row.
4. **Find All Solutions**: Continue this process until all rows are filled without conflicts, indicating a solution. We then add this configuration to our results list and backtrack to find other possible configurations.
5. **Convert to Required Output**: Once we have a working solution, we convert the placement representation into the required string format and add it to our result set.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Below is a detailed Python solution for the N-Queens problem. The code will be broken down afterward.

```python
def solveNQueens(n):
    def createBoard(state):
        board = []
        for i in state:
            row = '.' * i + 'Q' + '.' * (n - i - 1)
            board.append(row)
        return board
    
    def backtrack(row, diagonals, anti_diagonals, cols, state):
        if row == n:
            board = createBoard(state)
            solutions.append(board)
            return
        for col in range(n):
            curr_diag = row - col
            curr_anti_diag = row + col
            if col in cols or curr_diag in diagonals or curr_anti_diag in anti_diagonals:
                continue
            cols.add(col)
            diagonals.add(curr_diag)
            anti_diagonals.add(curr_anti_diag)
            state.append(col)
            
            backtrack(row + 1, diagonals, anti_diagonals, cols, state)
            
            cols.remove(col)
            diagonals.remove(curr_diag)
            anti_diagonals.remove(curr_anti_diag)
            state.pop()
    
    solutions = []
    backtrack(0, set(), set(), set(), [])
    return solutions
```

Here's what each part does:

- `solveNQueens(n)`: This is the main function which will be invoked with `n`, the size of the board and the number of queens.

- `createBoard(state)`: A helper function that takes the list `state`, which is a list indicating the column positions of queens in each row, and returns a list of strings representing the board configuration.

- `backtrack(row, diagonals, anti_diagonals, cols, state)`: This is a recursive helper function that attempts to place a queen in each column of the current row. It uses the parameters `diagonals`, `anti_diagonals`, and `cols` to keep track of which diagonals, anti-diagonals, and columns are already occupied by queens, thus ensuring that no two queens can attack each other. The `state` keeps track of the column positions of queens.

- `solutions`: A list to store the final board configurations that satisfy the N-Queens conditions.

The solution involves checking the column (`col`), diagonal (`curr_diag`), and anti-diagonal (`curr_anti_diag`) to determine if placing a queen will lead to a conflict. If placing a queen is valid, we add the current column to `cols`, `diagonals`, and `anti_diagonals` to block these lines from future queen placements, and we add the column index to `state`.

### Elaborate Examples:
For `n=4`, the solution will be:
```
[
 ["".Q.."",  // Solution 1
  ""...Q"",
  ""Q..."",
  ""..Q.""],

 [""..Q."",  // Solution 2
  ""Q..."",
  ""...Q"",
  "".Q..""]
]
```
These are the two possible solutions for 4 queens on a 4x4 board.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: The algorithm's time complexity is *O(N!)*. This comes from the idea that we have N options in the first row, N-1 in the second, and so on. Since backtracking ensures that we only explore valid possibilities, we don't actually evaluate all *N^N* options.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is *O(N)*. This arises from storing the current state (which takes *O(N)* space), and the recursive call stack for placing queens, which can go up to *N* levels deep in the worst case.

### Real-World Applications:
The N-Queens problem is a prototypical example for constraint satisfaction problems, which have applications in areas such as scheduling, planning, designing, and optimizing systems where a set of objects must satisfy a number of constraints or limitations.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- Remember to check both diagonals for each queen's position.
- Use sets to quickly check for conflicts (constant time operation).
 
### Problem Pattern Identification:
The N-Queens problem is an example of the backtracking algorithmic pattern. Backtracking is used in combinatorial problems where you need to find all (or some) feasible solutions and involves exploring each possibility and abandoning it (""backtracking"") if it does not lead to a solution.

Each of these problems involves exploring a solution space to find valid configurations which meet specific conditions, making them closely related to the N-Queens problem in terms of patterns and strategies used to approach them."
52,"LeetCode Problem 52 is titled ""N-Queens II"". This problem is a follow-up to the N-Queens problem, where the challenge is to find all distinct solutions to the N-Queens puzzle, but in this case, you are only asked to return the number of distinct solutions instead of listing them all.

Here is the problem statement:

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n×n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n queens, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

### Problem Breakdown:
- The puzzle is played on an n×n chessboard.
- You have n queens to place on this board.
- No two queens should be able to attack each other, meaning:
  - No two queens can be placed on the same row.
  - No two queens can be placed on the same column.
  - No two queens can be placed on the same diagonal.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
To solve this problem, you can take a similar approach as with the N-Queens I problem by using backtracking. The backtracking algorithm will place a queen on the board and then move to the next row to place another queen. At each step, you need to ensure that the newly placed queen is not in conflict with the already placed queens. The process repeats until all queens are placed on the board or until it is determined that no valid position is available for the next queen, at which point the algorithm backtracks.

The primary difference between N-Queens I and N-Queens II is that in the former, you needed to generate all possible board configurations, while in the latter, you only need to count the number of such valid configurations. Therefore, you do not need to store the board states, which reduces space complexity.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Let's break down the Python code that implements the backtracking approach to solve this problem. 

Firstly, we need to define the function `totalNQueens` that accepts an integer `n`:
```python
def totalNQueens(n: int) -> int:
    def can_place(row, col):
        # Some logic to check if a queen can be placed at this row & col
        pass

    def backtrack(row):
        # Some logic to place the next queen
        pass

    return backtrack(0)
```

Within `totalNQueens`, we have two nested functions, `can_place` and `backtrack`. `can_place` is responsible for checking whether a queen can be placed in a given row and column without conflict. `backtrack` will use `can_place` to try placing queens on the board and backtrack if needed. Finally, we start the backtracking process with `backtrack(0)` by trying to place the first queen in the first row.

Let's fill in the `can_place` function:
```python
def can_place(row, col):
    # Check column
    for i in range(row):
        if board[i] == col or \
           board[i] - i == col - row or \
           board[i] + i == col + row:
            return False
    return True
```

In this function, `board` is a list that we will define in `totalNQueens` to keep track of where queens are placed. `board[i]` denotes the column position of the queen in the `i`-th row.

Now, let's implement the `backtrack` function:
```python
def backtrack(row):
    if row == n:
        return 1  # All queens are placed. Found a solution.
    count = 0
    for col in range(n):
        if can_place(row, col):
            board[row] = col
            count += backtrack(row + 1)
            # No need to remove the queen, just try the next placement.
    return count
```

The `backtrack` function tries to place a queen in each column of the current row, and if it's successful, recursively calls itself to place a queen in the next row. If `row == n`, it means queens are successfully placed, and we have found one distinct solution, so we return 1. For each row, we keep a count of the number of solutions found by recursive calls.

Now let's put it all together:
```python
def totalNQueens(n: int) -> int:
    def can_place(row, col):
        for i in range(row):
            if board[i] == col or \
               board[i] - i == col - row or \
               board[i] + i == col + row:
                return False
        return True

    def backtrack(row):
        if row == n:
            return 1
        count = 0
        for col in range(n):
            if can_place(row, col):
                board[row] = col
                count += backtrack(row + 1)
        return count

    board = [-1] * n
    return backtrack(0)
```

In the above code, `board` is initialized with -1 indicating no queens are placed yet. The function `totalNQueens` then returns the total number of solutions by starting the backtracking process.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n!), because we are trying to place queens one by one and there are n choices for the first queen, n-1 choices for the second, and so on. However, the actual time complexity might be better due to early rejections in cases when two queens threaten each other.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), since we are using a single list to store the `board` state. The additional space for the call stack is also O(n), because the maximum depth of the recursion is n. 

Real-World Applications:
The N-Queens problem is a classic example of a constraint satisfaction problem, which is prevalent in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, scheduling, and game development. It teaches concepts that can be applied in real-world applications where various constraints need to be satisfied while making certain decisions.

Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- One common pitfall is not handling the diagonals correctly when checking if placing a queen is valid.
- Another pitfall is forgetting to count the number of solutions, instead of directly returning when a solution is found. 
- A trick that can be used is to represent diagonals mathematically to reduce the need for complex data structures.

Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem is a classic example of backtracking where you build up a solution incrementally and abandon it (""backtrack"") as soon as it is determined that the solution is not viable (""reject"").

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:
There are numerous problems related to backtracking on LeetCode, such as:
- N-Queens (Problem 51)
- Sudoku Solver (Problem 37)
- Combination Sum (Problem 39)
- Permutations (Problem 46)
- Subsets (Problem 78)
- Palindrome Partitioning (Problem 131)

Each of these problems can be solved using backtracking, and they rely on a deep understanding of recursion, state management, and constraint satisfaction. The skills learned from solving the N-Queens II problem are directly applicable to these related problems."
53,"LeetCode problem number 53 is titled ""Maximum Subarray"". This is a classic problem in computer science that's often used to teach the concept of dynamic programming, although there are multiple ways to solve it. Below is a thorough breakdown of the problem and its solutions.

### Problem Statement

The problem asks to find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) within an integer array that has the largest sum.

Here's an example provided by LeetCode:

```
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

### Subtleties in the Problem Statement

1. Contiguous Subarray: The subarray should be a continuous part of the original array, without rearranging the elements.
2. At Least One Number: The subarray can't be empty and must have at least one number from the original array.
3. Largest Sum: The summation of the numbers in the subarray should be maximum among all possible contiguous subarrays.

### Solution Rationale

#### Approach 1: Brute Force (Naive)

In the brute force approach, you would calculate the sum of all possible contiguous subarrays and keep track of the maximum sum you encounter. This would require two nested for-loops: the outer loop to set the starting point and the inner loop to expand the subarray and calculate the sum.

This approach, while simple to understand and implement, is highly inefficient as it has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. Because of this, it's not practical for large inputs and can lead to a timeout on platforms like LeetCode.

#### Approach 2: Divide and Conquer

The divide and conquer approach breaks down the array into halves repeatedly until the subarrays are trivially solvable (containing only one element). Then, it merges solutions of subarrays while finding maximum subarrays that cross the dividing line. The maximum subarray is the one that has the highest sum of the left maximum, right maximum, and crossing maximum.

This method is more efficient than the brute force approach but still not as optimal as it could be. It has a time complexity of O(n log n).

#### Approach 3: Dynamic Programming (Kadane's Algorithm) [Recommended]

Kadane's algorithm is the most efficient for this problem. It's a dynamic programming approach that operates in O(n) time complexity. The idea is to iterate through the array while keeping track of the current subarray sum. If at any point the current subarray sum becomes negative, it is reset to zero. This is because a negative sum will only decrease the sum of any subarray that follows. The maximum sum found during this iteration is the answer.

### Python Code Explanation

Let's go through the implementation of Kadane's Algorithm:

```python
def maxSubArray(nums):
    max_sum = current_sum = nums[0]
    
    for num in nums[1:]:
        current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
    return max_sum
```

- `max_sum` is initialized with the first element of the array. This will store the maximum sum encountered so far.
- `current_sum` is also initialized with the first element. This represents the current subarray sum.
- We start iterating from the second element of the array (`nums[1:]`).
- For each element, we check if adding it to the `current_sum` would increase its value. If not (or if the `current_sum` is negative), we start a new subarray with the current element (`max(num, current_sum + num)`).
- We then update `max_sum` if `current_sum` is larger.
- Finally, we return `max_sum`, which contains the largest subarray sum after iterating through the entire array.

### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of Kadane's algorithm is O(n) because it involves a single pass through the array.

The space complexity is O(1) since it only uses two variables regardless of the input size.

### Real-World Applications

The Maximum Subarray problem can represent real-world situations where you need to find an optimal contiguous segment from a sequence of values. This could apply in financial contexts to determine the best period to invest or trade, or in signal processing to find the segment of a signal with maximum strength.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Initially forgetting to handle negative numbers, especially when the array contains all negative numbers.
- Missing the case when the maximum subarray is just a single element (which can be the case when all elements are negative except one).

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem involves finding optimal contiguous sequences, which is typical for dynamic programming. Kadane's algorithm teaches us about the importance of local versus global optima and how prior states can influence the current decision (to continue the subarray or start anew).

### Similar Problems

Problems related to Kadane's algorithm or dynamic programming with subarray computations include:

- LeetCode 152 - Maximum Product Subarray
- LeetCode 121 - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
- LeetCode 918 - Maximum Sum Circular Subarray

Each problem adds its own twist to the concept of maximizing a certain subarray property. For example, in problem 152, the focus is on product instead of sum, and in problem 918, the subarray could wrap around the end of the array. However, the core idea of optimizing a sequence of elements remains the same."
54,"LeetCode problem number 54 is the ""Spiral Matrix"" problem. Let's break down the problem statement, explore solution strategies, and discuss the complexities associated with this problem.

### Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` `matrix` of integers, the task is to return all elements of the `matrix` in spiral order.

Spiral order means that you would start at the top-left corner of the `matrix` and traverse it peripherally, moving right until you reach the end, then down, then left, and finally up, to complete one boundary. Afterward, you continue this spiral inward until all elements have been visited.

Example:
```
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
```
In this example, the traversal would go across the first row (1, 2, 3), then down the last column (6, 9), then backward across the bottom row (8, 7), then up the first column (4), and finally, the middle element (5).

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, there are a few strategies we can employ:

- **Simulation Approach:** We simulate the process of traversing the `matrix` in a spiral order. This involves keeping track of our current direction and position and changing direction whenever we hit the border of the `matrix` or an already visited element. We'll need explicit boundary checks.

- **Layer-by-Layer Approach:** The `matrix` can be seen as a collection of concentric rectangular layers. We peel off these layers one by one, and for each layer, we can retrieve the elements in spiral order straightforwardly than in the simulation approach.

### Python Code for Simulation Approach

```python
def spiralOrder(matrix):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return []
    
    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    seen = [[False] * cols for _ in matrix]
    result = []
    dr, dc = [0, 1, 0, -1], [1, 0, -1, 0]  # Direction vectors
    r = c = di = 0  # Start position and direction index

    for _ in range(rows * cols):
        result.append(matrix[r][c])
        seen[r][c] = True
        cr, cc = r + dr[di], c + dc[di]

        if 0 <= cr < rows and 0 <= cc < cols and not seen[cr][cc]:
            r, c = cr, cc
        else:
            di = (di + 1) % 4  # Change direction
            r, c = r + dr[di], c + dc[di]

    return result
```

**Code Explanation:**
- Check for an empty `matrix` at the start.
- Determine the dimensions of the `matrix` and initialize a 2D array to keep track of visited elements (`seen`).
- Initialize an array `result` to store the spiral order.
- Define direction vectors `dr` and `dc` that represent the directional changes (right, down, left, up).
- Iterate through each element in the `matrix`. Use `seen` to ensure you don't visit an element more than once.
- If we hit a boundary or a visited element, we change direction.

### Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** The time complexity is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the matrix. Each element is accessed exactly once.

**Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(n) as well, due to the `seen` matrix that's used to keep track of visited elements. In addition, the `result` array also requires space, but since its size is equivalent to the input size, it doesn't increase the overall order of the space complexity.

### Layer-by-Layer Approach Python Code (Alternative)

```python
def spiralOrder(matrix):
    def spiral_coords(r1, r2, c1, c2):
        for c in range(c1, c2 + 1):
            yield r1, c
        for r in range(r1 + 1, r2 + 1):
            yield r, c2
        if r1 < r2 and c1 < c2:
            for c in range(c2 - 1, c1, -1):
                yield r2, c
            for r in range(r2, r1, -1):
                yield r, c1

    if not matrix: return []
    result = []
    r1, r2 = 0, len(matrix) - 1
    c1, c2 = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1
    while r1 <= r2 and c1 <= c2:
        for r, c in spiral_coords(r1, r2, c1, c2):
            result.append(matrix[r][c])
        r1 += 1; r2 -= 1
        c1 += 1; c2 -= 1

    return result
```

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: O(n), as each element is still only visited once.
- Space Complexity: O(1), not counting the output array, because we only use a constant amount of additional space.

### Practical Applications

The problem of outputting elements in a spiral order can find applications in various fields such as:

- **Graphical Rendering:** In some graphical rendering scenarios, it might be necessary to render pixels in a non-standard traversal order, such as in animations or transitions.
- **Matrix Processing:** In data analysis or processing, such ordering might be required for specific matrix transformations or effects.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- **Boundary Checking:** It's crucial to prevent indexing out of the bounds of a matrix. Being off by one can easily happen in such problems.
- **Direction Change:** Correctly identifying when to change direction is vital to prevent infinite loops and ensure correct traversal.
- **Single Row or Column Matrices:** Handle edge cases properly, such as matrices with only one row or one column.

55,"LeetCode Problem #55 is titled ""Jump Game"". Below, I'll provide an extensive problem breakdown, followed by an in-depth solution rationale, code explanation, examples, complexity analysis, real-world applications, common pitfalls, and tricks, pattern identification, and links to similar problems.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
In the ""Jump Game"" problem, you are given an array of non-negative integers where each integer represents the maximum jump length at that position. Your task is to determine if you can reach the last index starting from the first index.

For example, given the array `[2,3,1,1,4]`, the answer is `True`. You can jump from index `0` to `1`, then from index `1` to `4`.

However, if given the array `[3,2,1,0,4]`, the answer is `False`. Despite making various jumps, you inevitably reach an index from which you can't advance further because of a value of `0`.

A subtle nuance of the problem is that you can jump fewer steps than the number at the current position if it's advantageous. This means that while greedy solutions are often ideal, they need to account for these subtleties.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
The problem can be approached in multiple ways: greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and backtracking. However, a greedy algorithm is often the most efficient for this specific problem.

#### Greedy Algorithm:
The greedy approach involves moving from left to right across the array, at each step updating the farthest index that can be reached. As we iterate through the array, if we find that at any point, the farthest index we can reach (let's call it `maxReach`) is less than or equal to the current index and the current index is not the last index, we know it is impossible to reach the end, so we return `False`. If we move through the array without encountering this situation, we return `True`.

The greedy method is preferred because it can solve the problem with linear time complexity, which is more efficient than other methods like dynamic programming or backtracking, which have higher time complexities.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
```python
def canJump(nums):
    maxReach = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if i > maxReach:
            return False
        maxReach = max(maxReach, i + num)
    return True
```
- `maxReach` is initialized to `0`, representing the farthest we can go initially.
- We start iterating through the `nums` list with both the index `i` and the value `num`.
- For each position `i`, we check if `i` is greater than `maxReach`. If so, we cannot reach this position, and so we return `False`.
- Otherwise, we update `maxReach` with the maximum of itself and `i + num`, which represents the farthest we can go from this position.
- After the loop, if we never returned `False`, we are able to reach the end, and we return `True`.

### Elaborate Examples:
1. `nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]` - The function returns `True`. The jumps can be 2 -> 3 -> 4 (the end).
2. `nums = [3, 2, 1, 0, 4]` - The function returns `False`. Although you start with a jump length of 3, the zero at index 3 prevents reaching the last index.
3. `nums = [0]` - The function returns `True` because we are already at the last index at the start.
4. `nums = [2, 5, 0, 0]` - The function returns `True`. You can jump from the first index to the second, which is enough to reach the last index.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. We only make one pass through the array.
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`, as we use a fixed number of variables, regardless of the size of the input array.

### Real-World Applications:
This problem can represent many real-world scenarios where resources are limited and need to be optimally used to reach a goal. For example, in network routing, decisions must be made at each node (hop) based on the maximum range to the next node, similar to the jumps in the array.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- One pitfall is not considering that you can jump less than the number at the current position. You don't always have to take the maximum jump.
- A trick is to realize you don't need to track the path that gets you to the end—only whether it's possible or not.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
The ""Jump Game"" is an example of a greedy algorithm problem where at each step you make the locally optimal choice and hope that this leads to the globally optimal solution. Recognizing problems where local optimums lead to a global optimum is crucial for applying greedy algorithms effectively.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:
Similar problems involve variations of this reaching the target situation, such as:
- **LeetCode #45 - Jump Game II:** This problem asks for the minimum number of jumps to reach the last index, which requires a different approach.
- **LeetCode #1345 - Jump Game IV:** This problem introduces additional complexity by allowing jumps between any indices with the same value.
- **LeetCode #1306 - Jump Game III:** This problem allows jumping in both directions (left or right), posing a different kind of challenge.

In each of these, while the core concept of making jumps based on array values is maintained, differences in the rules require adapting strategies. The skills learned in ""Jump Game"" around greedy algorithms and assessing reachability are helpful for these related challenges."
56,"LeetCode Problem #56 is titled ""Merge Intervals,"" and it is a classic problem dealing with intervals. Given a collection of intervals, you are required to merge all overlapping intervals and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the problem, solution strategies, and associated complexities:

**Problem Breakdown:**

- You are given an array of intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`.
- You may assume that each interval's `starti` is less than or equal to `endi`.
- Overlapping intervals mean that there is a common portion in the intervals. For example, [1,3] and [2,6] overlap because they both contain the segment from 2 to 3.
- Your task is to merge all overlapping intervals.
- Merging intervals means that if two intervals are overlapping, they are combined into a new interval that starts at the earliest `start` time and ends at the latest `end` time among them. So for the example above, [1,3] and [2,6] would merge into [1,6].

**In-Depth Solution Rationale:**

One efficient way to approach this problem is to sort the input array of intervals based on the start times. This will allow us to easily look at each interval and determine if it overlaps with the previously considered interval as we iterate through the sorted array.

Once we have the sorted list of intervals, we can walk through the intervals and compare the end of the current interval to the start of the next. If they overlap (current interval's end is greater than or equal to the next interval's start), we can merge these intervals by updating the current interval's end to the maximum of the two intervals' ends. If they do not overlap, we can add the current interval to the merged output and move on to the next.

**Detailed Python Code Explanation:**

Let's translate the rationale above into Python code:

```python
def merge(intervals):
    # Sort the intervals by the start time
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        # If the merged list is empty or the current interval does not overlap with the previous,
        # simply append it.
        if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            # Otherwise, there is overlap, so we merge the current and previous intervals.
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])
    
    return merged
```

Line by line breakdown:

- Line 2: We start by sorting the intervals. The `sort` method is used, with a lambda function as the key that tells the sort to arrange the intervals by their start time (the first element of each interval).
- Line 4: `merged` is initialized as an empty array where the merged intervals will be stored.
- Lines 5-11: We iterate through each interval in the sorted list.
  - Line 7: We check if the list is empty or if the current interval does not overlap with the last element of the merged list (i.e., there's no overlap if the last interval's end is less than the current interval's start).
  - Line 8: If there's no overlap, we simply add the current interval to the merged list.
  - Lines 9-11: If there's overlap, we merge the intervals by updating the last element's end time to the maximum of the two ends.

**Elaborate Examples:**

Suppose we are given the following array of intervals: `[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`.

1. Sort by starts: `[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]` (was already sorted in this case).
2. Compare [1,3] with [2,6], they overlap. The merged interval will be [1,6].
3. [8,10] does not overlap with [1,6], so we add [8,10] to the merged list.
4. [15,18] does not overlap with any in the merged list, so we add [15,18] as well.
5. The final merged array will be `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`.

**Thorough Complexity Analysis:**

- Time Complexity: The time complexity of the solution is `O(n log n)` due to the sort operation at the beginning. The iteration itself takes `O(n)` time as we go through the intervals only once.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is `O(n)`, which is required to store the `merged` intervals. In the worst case, where no intervals overlap, the merged list will contain all the intervals from the original list.

**Real-World Applications:**

This problem is highly relevant in applications involving scheduling, time management, or any system that processes intervals or ranges. Examples include merging time slots for meeting schedules, condensing ranges of IP addresses in access control lists, or simplifying time ranges for reservations.

**Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:**

- Forgetting to sort the intervals before merging can lead to incorrect results.
- Overlooking edge cases where intervals just touch (e.g., [1,2] and [2,3]) should be considered non-overlapping according to most definitions but depends on the problem statement.
- Mutable lists: When merging, ensure you do not inadvertently mutate intervals that should remain separate.

**Problem Pattern Identification:**

Recognizing that this problem falls into the category of interval problems is key. Interval problems often involve sorting based on start or end times, then iterating through the sorted intervals to aggregate or combine them based on specific rules.

**Extensive Links to Similar Problems:**

Here are some related LeetCode problems that involve intervals:

- ""Insert Interval"" (LeetCode Problem #57): Involves inserting a new interval into a set of non-overlapping intervals and merging if necessary.
- ""Non-overlapping Intervals"" (LeetCode Problem #435): Instead of merging, the task here is to find the minimum number of intervals to remove to eliminate all overlaps.
- ""Meeting Rooms II"" (LeetCode Problem #253): This problem asks for the minimum number of conference rooms required to hold all the meetings, which again involves interval processing.

Each of these problems requires a variation on the strategy used to solve the ""Merge Intervals"" problem but shares the common approach of sorting and then iterating over the intervals. The skills learned in solving ""Merge Intervals"" can be applied to these new challenges."
57,"LeetCode problem number 57 is titled ""Insert Interval"". This problem falls under the category of array and interval manipulation. The problem statement and requirements are as follows:

**Problem Statement**:
You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represent the start and the end of the i-th interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `start_i`. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Your task is to insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that the intervals are merged if necessary and still sorted in ascending order by start. The merged interval should be such that it covers all the numbers that were covered by `intervals` and `newInterval`.

The result should not have any overlap, and intervals in the result should be as minimal as they can possibly be, that is, no two intervals in the result should be able to merge into one interval.

**Examples**:
1. Given `intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]]` and `newInterval = [2,5]`, the result should be `[[1,5],[6,9]]`.
2. Given `intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]]` and `newInterval = [4,8]`, the result should be `[[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]`.

**Constraints**:
- `0 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= start_i <= end_i <= 10^5`
- `intervals` is sorted by `start_i` in strictly increasing order.
- `newInterval.length == 2`
- `0 <= start <= end <= 10^5`

**Solution Rationale**:
There are multiple ways to solve this problem, but a common approach is to iterate through each interval in `intervals` and consider three cases:

1. **If the current interval ends before the new interval starts**, simply add the current interval to the result list because there is no overlap.

2. **If the current interval starts after the new interval ends**, add `newInterval` to the result list since we know that no other intervals will overlap with it (as the list is sorted), and then add all remaining intervals to the result list.

3. **If the current interval overlaps with the new interval**, we need to merge them. This is done by updating the `newInterval` to have the minimum of the start points and the maximum of the end points of both the `newInterval` and the current interval.

After processing all intervals from the input, if the new interval has not been added to the result, it is added at the end since it doesn't overlap with any of the intervals in the result list.

**Python Code Explanation**:
In the Python code, we would loop through each interval in `intervals` while considering the cases above. The merging case requires us to update `newInterval`, while in the other two cases we add intervals to the result list. At the end, after we've processed all intervals, we need to check if `newInterval` has been added to result; if not, it should be appended.

**Complexity Analysis**:
- Time Complexity: Since we're iterating through the list of intervals only once, the time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of intervals in the input list.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is `O(n)` as well for the result list that we're constructing. In the worst-case scenario, none of the intervals will merge, so we'll have all original intervals and the new interval in our result list.

Let's code this up in Python to show how it can be implemented."
58,"LeetCode Problem 58 is titled ""Length of Last Word."" This is a problem from the Strings category and its difficulty level is marked as Easy. Below, I will break down the problem, offer a solution strategy, explain the Python code, provide examples, analyze complexity, discuss its real-world applications, and highlight some related problems.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
The problem statement is given as follows:

Given a string `s` consisting of some words separated by spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. A word is a maximal substring consisting only of non-space characters.

The string `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces, as well as multiple spaces between words. The last word is the last non-empty substring that appears after splitting `s` by spaces. It is guaranteed that the `s` contains at least one word.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
To solve this problem, we need to consider potentially trimming the trailing spaces, split the string into words, and find the length of the last word. Here are a couple of approaches you could take:

1. **Splitting and Traversing:** You could split the string by spaces to get a list of words and then return the length of the last element in the list. But since we only need the length of the last word, we can optimize this approach by traversing the string from the end.

2. **Reverse Traversal:** To avoid creating additional data structures, you can traverse the string from the end until you hit the first non-space character, and then count the length of the word from there until you hit a space or the beginning of the string.

The reverse traversal is preferred because it saves the additional space complexity incurred when creating the list after splitting the string.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
```python
def lengthOfLastWord(s):
    length = 0
    # Start from the end of the string and work backwards.
    for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
        # If we haven't reached the end of the last word yet
        if s[i] != ' ':
            length += 1
        # If this is the first space after some non-space characters
        elif length > 0:
            return length
    return length
```

- We initialize `length` as `0`, which will be used to count the characters in the last word.
- We loop backwards through the string using a range starting from the last index, going down to zero (inclusive).
- If we find a non-space character, we increment `length`.
- If we find a space character after having found a non-space character (i.e., after the length has started counting), that means we have reached the end of the last word, so we can return `length`.
- If the loop finishes without having found a space after the last word, we just return `length`, as it represents the length of the only or last word.

### Elaborate Examples
Let's apply our function to a couple of examples:

```python
assert lengthOfLastWord(""Hello World"") == 5
assert lengthOfLastWord("" fly me   to   the moon  "") == 4
assert lengthOfLastWord(""luffy is still joyboy"") == 6
```

In the first example (""Hello World""), the last word is ""World,"" which has a length of 5. In the second example ("" fly me   to   the moon  ""), there are trailing spaces, and after disregarding them, the last word is ""moon,"" which has a length of 4. In the third example (""luffy is still joyboy""), the last word is ""joyboy"" with a length of 6.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. This is because, in the worst case, we traverse the entire string from end to start. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a fixed amount of additional space to store the length.

### Real-World Applications
This problem mimics real-world scenarios where you might want to parse texts and retrieve specific parts of it, such as extracting certain information from logs, processing commands in a command-line interface where you might be interested in the last argument, or any text analysis application.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks
One common pitfall would be to split the string and generate a list of all words, then access the last one. While this works, it is not the most efficient in terms of space.

Another tricky point could be handling strings that have a large number of trailing spaces. A less optimized solution might have trouble handling this efficiently, but the reverse traversal approach is robust against this variation.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem falls into the category of string manipulation and traversal. The patterns identified here are useful for dealing with string parsing and can be applied to a host of other related problems.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems
Here are some LeetCode problems that involve similar concepts:

- Problem 344: Reverse String
- Problem 151: Reverse Words in a String
- Problem 205: Isomorphic Strings

Each of these problems requires string manipulation skills and can benefit from a solid understanding of how to traverse and manipulate strings efficiently. They vary in complexity but share the common thread of examining and transforming strings based on certain criteria."
59,"LeetCode Problem 59 is titled ""Spiral Matrix II"". This problem is concerned with generating a square matrix that is filled with elements from 1 to n^2 in a spiral order.

### Problem Statement

Given a positive integer n, generate an n x n matrix filled with elements from 1 to n^2 in spiral order.

### Example

Input: `n = 3`
Output: 
```
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 8, 9, 4 ],
 [ 7, 6, 5 ]
]
```

In this example, we start at the top-left of the matrix, and we proceed right, then down, then left, and finally up, and repeat this process until the entire matrix is filled with the numbers from 1 to n^2, in this case, 1 to 9.

### Understanding the Problem

The main challenge of this problem is determining the direction we are moving in the matrix at any given point and when to turn. Typically, we need to fill the matrix layer by layer, starting with the outermost layer and working our way inward.

The direction changes from:

1. Right (move to the rightmost column of the current layer)
2. Down (move to the bottom row of the current layer)
3. Left (move to the leftmost column of the current layer)
4. Up (move to the top row of the next inner layer)

### Solution Strategy

To solve this problem, we can simulate the process of moving in a spiral:

1. Maintain four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, initially set to the borders of the matrix.
2. Use a loop to fill the matrix, proceeding in the spiral order: right -> down -> left -> up.
3. After completing one direction, we update the corresponding boundary to move one step inward.
4. Continue the process until all elements from 1 to n^2 are placed.
5. Use a counter that increments with each filled cell.

### Python Code Explanation

I will provide a Python function that implements the above strategy. Time to write the code and break it down.

```python
def generateMatrix(n):
    if n == 0:
        return []
    
    # Initialize the matrix with zeros
    matrix = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]

    top, bottom, left, right = 0, n-1, 0, n-1
    num = 1
    
    while top <= bottom and left <= right:
        # Traverse from left to right
        for i in range(left, right + 1):
            matrix[top][i] = num
            num += 1
        top += 1

        # Traverse downwards
        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
            matrix[i][right] = num
            num += 1
        right -= 1

        # Traverse from right to left
        if top <= bottom:
            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):
                matrix[bottom][i] = num
                num += 1
            bottom -= 1

        # Traverse upwards
        if left <= right:
            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):
                matrix[i][left] = num
                num += 1
            left += 1
            
    return matrix
```

1. Create a matrix filled with zeros using a list comprehension. Each row is initialized with `n` zeros, and there are `n` such rows.
2. Keep track of the current borders or ""walls"" of the spiral, initially corresponding to the edges of the matrix.
3. Use a `num` variable to fill each cell, starting at 1 and going up to `n^2`.
4. Use a `while` loop to fill the matrix until `top` and `bottom`, or `left` and `right` meet, which signifies that the center of the spiral has been reached and there's no more space to fill.
5. For each of the four directions (right, down, left, up), use a `for` loop to fill the cells, then update the corresponding boundary variable.
6. After completing a direction, check if we should continue with the next direction or if we've reached the center. If we filled an entire row or column, we need to check if we reached the center before moving to the next direction.
7. Return the filled matrix.

### Complexity Analysis

Let's analyze the time and space complexity of this solution:

- **Time complexity**: The time complexity is O(n^2) because we must fill `n^2` cells, and we only pass through each cell once.
- **Space complexity**: The space complexity is O(n^2) for the output matrix, disregarding the space needed for the output, the extra space used by the algorithm is O(1) because we only use a few variables for the loops and boundaries.

### Practical Applications

This type of problem and its solution are common in problems related to pattern generation and computational geometry. Generating a spiral matrix could be a sub-problem in more complex applications like image processing, pathfinding in robotics, or simulations of space-filling algorithms.

### Tips and Common Pitfalls

- Do not forget to write boundary checks to prevent index out-of-bounds errors.
- It's important to correctly identify the conditions that indicate when a traverse in a particular direction is complete.
- Another potential pitfall is not correctly updating the boundary conditions after completing a spiral layer.

### Related Problems

Similar problems usually involve traversing through a matrix in a specific pattern. These might include:
- Spiral Matrix (LeetCode Problem 54): Traverse and return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.
- Diagonal Traverse (LeetCode Problem 498): Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in diagonal order.
- Rotate Image (LeetCode Problem 48): Rotate the matrix by ninety degrees.

Solving Spiral Matrix II lays a good foundation for understanding how to navigate and manipulate 2D arrays in more complex ways than the typical row-by-row or column-by-column traversal."
60,"LeetCode problem number 60 is titled ""Permutation Sequence."" This is a medium difficulty problem that asks you to find the k-th permutation sequence of a set of n numbers without having to generate all possible permutations.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem statement specifies that given two integers n and k, you need to return the k-th permutation sequence of the numbers [1, 2, ..., n]. It's important to understand that these permutations are supposed to be listed in lexicographic (dictionary) order, which means that the first permutation would be the numbers in ascending order, and the last permutation would have the numbers in descending order.

You must also consider that the intended solution for this problem should avoid generating all permutations due to the factorial time complexity, which would be impractical for larger values of n. Instead, the problem requires a more optimized approach, which involves generating only the k-th permutation directly.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

The key insight for an efficient solution hinges on understanding the structure of permutation sequences and making use of factorial number systems, or factoradics. Factorial number systems are helpful in this scenario as they allow you to determine the index of each digit in the k-th permutation without generating all permutations.

Here are the steps to find the k-th permutation sequence:

1. Precompute factorials of numbers up to n, as they are needed to find the indices of the numbers in the permutation.
2. Adjust k to be zero-indexed, as the permutation sequences in mathematical terms are usually 1-indexed.
3. Keep an array of the available numbers to add to the permutation sequence.
4. For each position in the sequence from 1 to n, compute the index of the number to place at that position:
   - The index is obtained by dividing (k - 1) by the factorial of the remaining length.
   - Append the number at that index to the sequence.
   - Update k by taking the modulus of k and the factorial of the remaining length.
   - Remove the number from the list of available numbers.
5. Repeat step 4 until all positions in the sequence are filled.

This process will yield the exact k-th permutation without having to enumerate all permutations.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's implement the Python code for the solution based on the rationale discussed:

```python
def getPermutation(n, k):
    # Step 1: Calculate the factorials up to n and initialize the list of numbers
    factorials = [1]
    numbers = [str(i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n):
        factorials.append(factorials[-1] * i)
        
    # Step 2: Decrement k for zero indexing
    k -= 1
    
    # Step 3: Build the k-th permutation sequence
    answer = []
    for i in range(n):
        # Step 4: Find the index for the current position
        idx = k // factorials[n - 1 - i]
        answer.append(numbers.pop(idx))
        
        # Step 4 (continued): Update k
        k %= factorials[n - 1 - i]
    
    return ''.join(answer)
```

In this code, `factorials` holds the precomputed factorial values, and `numbers` contains the list of available digits. The `for` loop iterates over each digit position to build the permutation string.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's consider the example where `n = 3` and `k = 3`.

The permutations in lexicographic order are: ""123"", ""132"", ""213"", ""231"", ""312"", ""321"". We need to find the 3rd permutation.

Using the algorithm:

- Compute factorials: `[1, 1, 2]`
- Convert k to zero-index: `k = 2`
- For i=0, idx = 2 // 2 = 1, answer = [""2""], numbers = [""1"", ""3""], k = 2 % 2 = 0
- For i=1, idx = 0 // 1 = 0, answer = [""2"", ""1""], numbers = [""3""], k = 0
- For i=2, idx = 0 // 1 = 0, answer = [""2"", ""1"", ""3""]

The 3rd permutation is ""213"".

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: The time complexity is O(n^2). The O(n^2) arises because there's an O(n) loop over the sequence's positions, and within that loop, the numbers list is manipulated (specifically, elements are popped by index), which also takes O(n) time in the worst case (as popping from the middle of a list can take O(n) time).

Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(n) because of the storage required for the factorials and the numbers list. 

(Continued in the next message due to length limitations)"
61,"LeetCode Problem 61 is titled ""Rotate List."" The challenge is to rotate a singly linked list to the right by k places, where k is a non-negative integer. Let's break down the problem into detailed steps and discuss the nuances that could affect the implementation. Afterward, I'll provide an in-depth solution rationale, a detailed Python code explanation, and various examples to demonstrate the solution.

### Problem Breakdown:
Given a singly-linked list and a non-negative integer k, the task is to rotate the list to the right by k places. If k is greater or equal to the length of the list, the rotation should wrap around.

Some things to keep in mind:
- A singly-linked list means each node only has a reference to the next node. There is no reference to the previous node.
- Rotating the list to the right by one place means that the last element becomes the first element.
- Rotating by an amount that is a multiple of the list's length should return the list in its original state, as each full rotation doesn't change the list.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer technique along with a few steps to efficiently rotate the list.

1. **Compute the length of the list.** This will help us normalize the value of k in case it is larger than the length of the list.
2. **Normalize k.** Since rotating a list with length `L` by `L` or any multiple of `L` results in the same list, we can use `k = k % L` to find the effective number of rotations needed.
3. **Find the new tail.** We need to find the new tail of the list, which will be the `(L - k - 1)`th node after normalization. This new tail's next node will be the new head after rotation.
4. **Rotate the list.** Set the current tail's `next` pointer to `None` and set the `next` pointer of the previous tail (before rotation) to what used to be the head of the list.

Strategic decisions include handling edge cases such as when the list is empty or when `k` is 0, as no rotation is necessary.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Here's what each part of the implementation does:

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head or not head.next or k == 0:
            return head  # No rotation needed
        
        # Compute the length of the list and the last node
        length = 1
        last_node = head
        while last_node.next:
            last_node = last_node.next
            length += 1
            
        # Normalize k
        k %= length
        
        if k == 0:
            return head  # The list remains the same after rotation
        
        # Find the new tail after rotation
        new_tail = head
        for _ in range(length - k - 1):
            new_tail = new_tail.next
        
        # Perform the rotation
        new_head = new_tail.next
        new_tail.next = None
        last_node.next = head
        
        return new_head
```

### Elaborate Examples:
- **Example 1:** List = `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`, k = 2. The rotated list should be `4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3`.
- **Example 2:** List = `0 -> 1 -> 2`, k = 4. Since k > length of list, k %= length = 1. The rotated list should be `2 -> 0 -> 1`.
- **Example 3:** List = `1`, k = 99. Since the list has only one element, any rotation will result in the same list.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the list. We go through the list to find its length, then we possibly iterate again to the rotation point.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as the rotation is done in-place and no additional data structure is used.

### Real-World Applications:
Rotating lists can be likened to scheduling tasks, where cycles are common and elements need to be moved around for prioritization or resource allocation. It is also a good representation of any system that requires circular handling, such as a round-robin tournament schedule.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- Forgetting to handle edge cases like an empty list, a list with only one element, or k being zero.
- Not normalizing k, leading to unnecessary iterations and potentially incorrect rotations.
- Missing the connection between the old tail and new head, resulting in lost nodes and an incomplete list.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem is an example of a linked list manipulation, specifically involving pointers and node reassignment. Recognizing this pattern aids in solving similar problems like reversing a linked list, merging two sorted linked lists, and dealing with cycles in linked lists.

62,"LeetCode Problem 62 is titled ""Unique Paths."" The problem is categorized as a Medium difficulty level problem under the ""Dynamic Programming"" section. Let me break down the problem for you in detail:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
In this problem, you're given a grid in the form of an `m x n` matrix, where `m` represents the number of rows and `n` represents the number of columns. The task is to find the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

The key constraints are:
- The number of rows `m` and the number of columns `n` will be in the range [1, 100].
- The robot must reach the bottom-right corner of the grid, starting from the top-left corner.

The subtle nuance in this problem is that you are restricted to moving only in two directions: down or right. This heavily influences the solution approach, as it simplifies the problem into a combinatorial one rather than a general path-finding problem like DFS or BFS, which would be applicable if you could move in any direction.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
There are various approaches to this problem, and I will explain each in detail.

**1. Brute Force (Recursion):**
The first intuitive method might be to use recursion to explore every possible path. From any cell `(i, j)`, you move to `(i+1, j)` or `(i, j+1)` until you reach `(m-1, n-1)`. This approach, however, is extremely inefficient and results in an exponential time complexity due to the re-computation of paths that overlap — this is a classic sign that dynamic programming could be used.

**2. Dynamic Programming:**
The optimal solution to this problem involves dynamic programming (DP) since the problem contains overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. Essentially, you want to build up the solution by calculating all the paths that lead to each cell and then using those results to build upon and compute paths to farther cells.

To do this, you create a DP table where each entry `dp[i][j]` represents the number of unique paths to reach the cell `(i, j)`. The base case is that for the first row and first column, there's only one path to each cell (either keep moving right for the first row or keep moving down for the first column). For all other cells, the unique paths to reach that cell is the sum of the paths to reach the cell above it (`dp[i-1][j]`) and the cell to the left of it (`dp[i][j-1]`).

**3. Combinatorial:**
A mathematical approach to this problem involves understanding that any path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner can be described as a series of `m-1` down moves and `n-1` right moves. This becomes a combination problem (`m+n-2 choose m-1` or `m+n-2 choose n-1`) which can be calculated using factorials or Pascal's triangle.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Let's focus on the DP approach for a detailed code explanation:
```python
def uniquePaths(m: int, n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize DP table with 1s for the first row and first column
    dp = [[1] * n for _ in range(m)]

    # Iterate through the table starting from the second row and second column
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            # Calculate the paths to the current cell
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]

    # The bottom-right corner has the answer
    return dp[-1][-1]
```

Explanation of the code:
- We initialize a 2D list `dp` where all elements in the first row and first column are `1`.
- We iterate over the cells starting from `(1, 1)` as we have already filled the first row and the first column.
- For each cell, we calculate the number of unique paths as the sum of unique paths from the top cell and the left cell: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]`.
- Once we have filled our `dp` table, the answer to the number of unique paths is in the bottom-right cell of our `dp` table: `dp[m-1][n-1]`.

### Elaborate Examples:
To give an example, let's consider a `3x3` grid. According to our DP approach:
```
Initial matrix (3x3):
1 1 1
1 0 0
1 0 0

After filling the DP table:
1 1 1
1 2 3   <- dp[1][1] = dp[0][1] + dp[1][0] = 1 + 1 = 2
1 3 6   <- dp[2][2] = dp[1][2] + dp[2][1] = 3 + 3 = 6
```
So, there are `6` unique paths in this `3x3` grid.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
For the dynamic programming solution:
- The time complexity is `O(m * n)` since we need to fill the DP table with `m * n` entries.
- The space complexity is `O(m * n)` for the storage of the DP table. However, you could optimize it to `O(n)` by noting that you only need the last row to compute the current row.

For the combinatorial solution:
- The time complexity is dominated by the time needed to calculate the combinations, which can be done in `O(m)` or `O(n)` depending on the implementation.
- The space complexity can be `O(1)` since no additional storage is needed.

### Real-World Applications:
This problem can be seen as a simplified version of more complex path-finding problems that could be applied to robotics (where you need to navigate a robot in a grid space) or, at a higher abstraction level, to decision-making scenarios (such as financial planning paths or strategic gameplay scenarios).

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
Common pitfalls may include not initializing the DP table properly or mismanaging the indices leading to an off-by-one error. For the combinatorial solution, handling large factorials without overflow can be challenging.

A good trick to optimize space for the DP solution is to use only one row or one column array, rather than a full 2D matrix, and then iterate through the matrix updating that array.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem is an example of a grid-based dynamic programming problem with very restricted movement, leading to a bottom-up DP solution that builds on previously computed values. Recognizing the pattern of computing paths based on two restricted movements is valuable for approaching similar grid problems.

Understanding the solution to the ""Unique Paths"" problem can provide a strong foundation for tackling these related problems, where the approach can be modified or expanded to adapt to the different constraints or objectives."
63,"LeetCode problem number 63 is titled ""Unique Paths II"". This problem is an extension of the problem ""Unique Paths"", often denoted as problem number 62 on LeetCode.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem statement of ""Unique Paths II"" is as follows:

You are given an `m x n` grid, where each cell can have one of two values:
- `0` means the cell is empty, and you can pass through,
- `1` means the cell contains an obstacle and cannot be passed through.

The task is to find the total number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid. You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

The presence of obstacles introduces a major complication to the original ""Unique Paths"" problem. Here's a nuanced aspect: if the starting cell (top-left) or the destination cell (bottom-right) contains an obstacle, there are no valid paths.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. At each cell in the grid, we need to calculate the number of ways to reach that cell from the top-left corner without hitting an obstacle.

The recursive intuition is that the number of unique paths to a given cell `(i, j)` is the sum of the unique paths to the cell directly above `(i - 1, j)` and to the cell directly to the left `(i, j - 1)`, assuming those cells don't contain an obstacle.

The base cases involve the cells in the first row or first column. For the first row or the first column, if there are no obstacles, there would be only one path to each cell (all moves are either right or down, respectively). But if an obstacle is encountered, all subsequent cells in that row or column cannot be reached, and therefore the number of paths to those cells is zero.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Here's a detailed explanation of a Python solution using dynamic programming with a 2D table:

```python
def uniquePathsWithObstacles(obstacleGrid):
    m, n = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])
    # Creating a 2D DP table initialized to 0
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    # Initialize the first cell
    dp[0][0] = 1 if obstacleGrid[0][0] == 0 else 0
    
    # Initialize the first column
    for i in range(1, m):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] if obstacleGrid[i][0] == 0 else 0
        
    # Initialize the first row
    for j in range(1, n):
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] if obstacleGrid[0][j] == 0 else 0
        
    # Fill the DP table
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = 0
                
    return dp[m-1][n-1]  # The bottom-right cell contains the answer
```

Let's break this down line by line:

- `m, n = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])`: We first store the dimensions of the grid.
- `dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]`: This initializes the DP table to all zeros. The DP table is used to store the count of unique paths to reach each cell.
- We initialize `dp[0][0]`, making sure to check for an obstacle in the starting cell. If there's an obstacle, `dp[0][0]` remains `0`, indicating no paths are available.
- The first column and row are initialized similarly, with the rule that if an obstacle is encountered, all subsequent cells in that line have zero paths.
- In the nested for loops, we iterate over the cells, calculating the unique path counts using the rule mentioned earlier. If a cell is an obstacle, we explicitly set `dp[i][j]` to `0`.
- Finally, `dp[m-1][n-1]` holds the count of unique paths to the bottom-right corner, and we return this value.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's consider two examples to illustrate how the DP table is filled out:

**Example 1:**
Input: `obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]`
Output: `2`

Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the grid. The DP table would be filled out as follows:

```
1 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 2
```

**Example 2:**
Input: `obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]`
Output: `1`

Explanation: The only obstacle blocks one potential path in the first row. The DP table would be filled out as:

```
1 0
1 1
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of the solution is O(m*n) since we need to fill out the DP table once, and each cell's calculation requires constant time. The space complexity is also O(m*n) because of the 2D DP table.

We could optimize the space complexity by using a single array (1D DP table) and iterating through the grid rows, constantly updating it, reducing the space complexity to O(n).

### Real-World Applications:

This problem can be equated to real-world scenarios such as robotics, where you might need to plan a path for a robot in an environment with obstacles. Computationally, it's a classic dynamic programming problem with applications in operations research and planning algorithms.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

Pitfalls in this problem might include not correctly handling the base cases, especially not accounting for obstacles in the start and end positions or the first row and column.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

The pattern of this problem is dynamic programming with a 2D DP table and handling base cases carefully. Recognizing that you need to solve a smaller subproblem before the larger one is crucial for dynamic programming problems.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:

There are several problems on LeetCode that share similarities with ""Unique Paths II"":

- Unique Paths (LeetCode 62)
- Minimum Path Sum (LeetCode 64)
- Different Ways to Add Parentheses (LeetCode 241)
- Climbing Stairs (LeetCode 70)
- Coin Change (LeetCode 322)

All these problems involve some form of dynamic programming or combinatorial computation. The skills you use to address one can often be transferable to the others with a bit of tweaking."
64,"LeetCode Problem 64 is titled ""Minimum Path Sum"" and it falls under the category of dynamic programming. Let's break down the problem statement and discuss the nuances, solution strategies, and code implementation in detail.

### Problem Statement:

Given a `m x n` grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from the top left to the bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path. You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The key points to understand in this problem are:

1. The grid consists of `m` rows and `n` columns.
2. Each cell in the grid has a non-negative integer value.
3. The path starts at the top-left corner (grid[0][0]) and ends at the bottom-right corner (grid[m-1][n-1]).
4. The path must be constructed by moving only downwards or rightwards.
5. The goal is to minimize the sum of the values of the cells visited along the path.
6. Only one optimal path needs to be determined, not all possible paths.

It's important to note that this is a classic optimization problem that can be naturally approached with dynamic programming due to the overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure properties.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

#### Dynamic Programming Approach:

The problem has an optimal substructure, meaning that the minimum path sum to reach a particular cell is independent of the path taken to reach that cell. Therefore, we can use a dynamic programming table to store the minimum sums we have calculated so far, and build upon them to find the solution.

The steps for the dynamic programming solution are:

1. If the current cell is the top-left cell, it doesn't come from another cell. So, the sum is the value of this cell itself.
2. If the cell is in the first row, it can only come from the left. The sum is the value of the current cell plus the sum for the cell to the left.
3. If the cell is in the first column, it can only come from above. The sum is the value of the current cell plus the sum for the cell above.
4. For all other cells, they can come from either left or above. Here, we choose the minimum sum between the two possible cells.

The last cell in the grid will contain the minimum path sum for the whole grid.

#### Implementation Details:

We can either create a separate DP table with the same dimensions as the grid or modify the grid in place.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's write the Python code that implements the dynamic programming solution.

```python
def minPathSum(grid):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    # Initialize the first row and first column of the DP grid
    for i in range(1, m):
        grid[i][0] += grid[i-1][0]
    for j in range(1, n):
        grid[0][j] += grid[0][j-1]
    
    # Compute the minimum path sums for the interior cells
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            grid[i][j] += min(grid[i-1][j], grid[i][j-1])
    
    # The bottom-right cell contains the final minimum path sum
    return grid[-1][-1]
```

Line by line, here's what the code does:

1. We obtain the dimensions of the grid (number of rows `m` and number of columns `n`).
2. We initialize the first column by cumulatively adding the values from the top down because these cells can only be reached from the above cell.
3. We initialize the first row by cumulatively adding the values from left to right because these cells can only be reached from the left cell.
4. We then iterate over the interior cells of the grid (excluding the first row and column which we've already initialized). Inside the nested loops, we calculate the minimum path sum for each cell by adding its own value to the minimum of the path sums from the cell above it and to the left of it.
5. Finally, we return the bottom-right cell's value which represents the minimum path sum for the entire grid.

### Elaborate Examples:

To better understand the algorithm, let's walk through an example grid:

```
[
  [1, 3, 1],
  [1, 5, 1],
  [4, 2, 1]
]
```

1. After processing the first row and column, the grid will look like this:
```
[
  [1, 4, 5],
  [2,  ,  ],
  [6,  ,  ]
]
```
2. Filling out the rest of the grid:
```
[
  [1, 4, 5],
  [2, 7, 6],
  [6, 8, 7]
]
```
3. The final minimum path sum is found at grid[2][2], which is `7`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of the solution is `O(m * n)` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This is because we need to process each cell exactly once to compute its minimum path sum.

The space complexity of the above implementation is `O(1)` if we modify the grid in place. If we were to use a separate DP table, it would be `O(m * n)`.

### Real-World Applications:

The problem can be translated to real-world scenarios such as finding the cheapest cost to travel through a grid-like city, minimizing energy consumption in routing electronic signals, or finding the most effective path through a risk assessment grid.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Forgetting to handle the first row and first column separately before processing the rest of the grid can lead to errors.
- Making sure to use the `min()` function correctly to consider both possible paths (from the left and from above).

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem is an instance of dynamic programming, specifically a 'grid-based' dynamic programming problem. Grid-based DP problems involve a 2D table where each cell represents a subproblem, and the solution is built iteratively by using previously solved subproblems.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:

Similar LeetCode problems that also involve dynamic programming patterns include:

- Unique Paths (LeetCode Problem 62)
- Unique Paths II (LeetCode Problem 63)
- Maximum Square (LeetCode Problem 221)

Each of these problems requires a dynamic programming approach where an optimal decision at each step leads to an overall optimal solution. They can all be solved with a similar tabulation strategy, deriving solutions from previously computed subproblems."
65,"LeetCode Problem 65 is titled ""Valid Number."" The problem deals with validating if a given string is a representation of a numerical value. Here's a detailed explanation of the problem, along with its various nuances:

### **Problem Statement**

You are given a string `s` and are required to determine if `s` can be interpreted as a decimal number. This means that the string must conform to the standards that are generally accepted for decimal numbers.

### **Specifics to consider:**

1. **Numeric characters**: The characters `0` through `9` are the standard numeric characters.

2. **Exponentiation character**: The character `e` or `E` can indicate that what follows is an exponent in scientific notation. For example, `3e2` means `3 * 10^2` which equals `300`.

3. **Decimal points**: A decimal point `.` may appear to indicate a fractional component of the number. For instance, `3.5` translates to `three plus one-half`.

4. **Sign characters**: Plus `+` or minus `-` signs may precede numbers to indicate their sign. The 'e' or 'E' can also be preceded by a sign to indicate the sign of the exponent, as in `3e+2`.

5. **Whitespace**: Whitespace characters are not allowed within the number, but it could appear before or after the number.

6. **Leading or trailing zeros**: They are allowed, as in `0042` or `42.00`.

7. **Leading or trailing decimal point**: A number can start or end with a decimal point, as in `.42` or `42.`.

8. **Scientific notation**: A number can be in the form of scientific notation, as in `42e2`, which is a valid number.

9. **Invalid characters**: Any other character besides these is not considered valid within a number.

### **Requirements for a Valid Number**

A valid number must adhere to the following constraints:

- It may or may not start with a `+` or `-`.
- It may contain one or more numeric characters.
- It may contain a decimal point, but if it does, there must be numeric characters either before or after it, or both.
- It may contain an `e` or `E` character to indicate scientific notation, but:
  - It must have numeric characters before the `e` or `E`.
  - It may have a sign character immediately after the `e` or `E`, followed by one or more numeric characters.

### **Clarifications**

The following are some clarifications for what does **not** constitute a valid number:

- Purely alphabetical strings (e.g., ""abc"").
- Numbers with multiple decimal points (e.g., ""1.2.3"").
- Numbers with multiple `e` characters (e.g., ""1e2e3"").
- Exponential notation without a preceding number (e.g., ""e3"").
- Exponential notation without following numbers (e.g., ""3e"").
- Leading or trailing whitespace within the numeric component (e.g., "" 1 "").

### **Approach to the Solution**

To solve this problem, one needs to implement a finite state machine (FSM) or a set of strict validation rules that a string must pass to be considered a valid number based on the above constraints.

A common strategy is to iterate through the string character by character, keeping track of what has been seen. For instance:

- Has a numeric character been encountered?
- Has a decimal point been seen, and if so, where was it relative to numeric characters?
- Has an exponent been seen, and what was the format of the number around it?

### **Examples**

Valid examples:
- `""2""` is a valid number.
- `""0089""` is a valid number with leading zeroes.
- `""-0.1""` is a valid negative decimal.
- `""+3.14""` is a valid positive decimal with a sign.
- `""4.""` is a valid number with a trailing decimal point.
- `""-3E-2""` is a valid negative scientific notation number with a decimal exponent.

Invalid examples:
- `""abc""` is not a valid number.
- `""1a""` is not a valid number.
- `""1e""` is not a valid number due to the incomplete exponential notation.
- `""e3""` starts with an exponent and contains no numbers.
- `""99e2.5""` is not valid because the exponent contains a decimal point.

### **Complexity Analysis**

The complexity analysis generally involves:
- **Time Complexity**: This is usually O(n), where n is the length of the string since we typically need to scan through all characters.
- **Space Complexity**: This is usually O(1) since the solution should operate with a constant amount of extra space, only keeping track of certain flags or state variables.

### **Practical Applications**

Knowing how to validate a numerical string is important in various applications, such as user input validation, data sanitization before database insertion, or preprocessing data for scientific computation where the format of numbers is essential.

### **Common Pitfalls and Tricks**

- Paying close attention to the edge cases involving signs, decimal points, and exponent notation is important.
- Simplifying the problem by trimming the input string can help to deal with whitespace without complicating the core logic.
- Using regular expressions can sometimes provide a quick and effective solution, but might not be as efficient as FSM implementations.

### **Problem-solving Pattern**

This problem falls under the general category of string parsing and finite state machines. Recognizing patterns within the string and handling each character based on the current state of our parsed number is generic to many problems involving complex string validations.

### **Linked Problems**

Similar LeetCode problems involving string parsing include:
- Problem 20: Valid Parentheses
- Problem 125: Valid Palindrome
- Problem 468: Validate IP Address

While they differ in specifics, the fundamental approach of parsing a string input based on certain rules or states can be applied in solving them as well."
66,"LeetCode Problem 66 is titled ""Plus One,"" and it is a problem in the domain of arrays and basic arithmetic operations.

## Problem Statement:

You are given a large integer represented as an array of digits, where each element in the array corresponds to a digit of the integer. The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contains a single digit. The task is to add one to the integer and return the resulting array of digits.

Here's the formal description of the problem:
```
Given a non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer, increment one to the integer. The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contains a single digit. You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except for the number 0 itself.
```

## Example:

If the input array is `[1,2,3]`, the integer it represents is `123`. After adding one to this number, we get `124`, and the output should be `[1,2,4]`.

## Solution Strategy:

Here's how you might approach the problem step by step:

1. Starting from the least significant digit (rightmost), add one to it.
2. If adding one does not result in a carry (i.e. the sum is less than 10), you can simply update the digit and return the array.
3. If there's a carry, you need to set the current digit to 0 and move to the next more significant digit (one position to the left) and add the carry to that digit. Repeat this process until there are no more carries or you've processed all digits.
4. If you have processed all digits and there's still a carry (this happens when all digits are `9`), then you need to append a new digit `1` at the beginning of the array to accommodate the carry.

### Python Code Explanation:

Let's look at the Python code implementing the above steps:

```python
def plusOne(digits):
    # Start from the last digit and add one to it
    n = len(digits)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        # If the current digit is less than 9, increment and return
        if digits[i] < 9:
            digits[i] += 1
            return digits
        # Set the current digit to 0 and continue to the next iteration
        digits[i] = 0

    # If all digits were 9, then we need to add a leading 1
    return [1] + digits
```

Let's break down the main parts of this solution:

- We iterate over the digits from the last digit to the first digit (`for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1)`).
- If the current digit is less than 9, we simply increment it by 1 and return the number (`digits[i] += 1` followed by a return statement).
- If the current digit is 9, setting it to 0 simulates the carry-over effect as we would do in manual addition (`digits[i] = 0`).
- After the loop, if there's still a carry (which means every digit was originally a 9), we create an new array with `1` followed by `0`s to represent that the number has increased in magnitude by one place value (`return [1] + digits`).

## Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of digits in the input array. This is because we potentially have to traverse the entire array of digits once in the worst-case scenario, that is, when all digits are `9`.
- Space Complexity: O(1), if we don't count the input and output array space. The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for the iteration variables and the carry.

## Edge Cases:

1. Input array is `[9,9,9]`: Here, the output should be `[1,0,0,0]`. It's a special case, as we need to increase the array size.
2. Input array with a single digit `[0]` or `[9]`.

## Real-World Applications:

This problem can represent situations where computations on large numbers that cannot be stored in traditional data types are required. Adding a count, incrementing a serial number, or processing a sequence iteratively are all practical scenarios.

## Common Pitfalls:

- Forgetting to handle the case where a digit other than the last one is less than `9`.
- Not managing the carry properly when all digits are `9`.

## Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem represents a common pattern where you iterate through a list or array while maintaining some state (in this case, the carry).

## Similar Problems:

- ""Add Binary"" (Problem 67): Similar digit-by-digit summation but in binary.
- ""Multiply Strings"" (Problem 43): More complex arithmetic operations between numbers represented as strings.
- ""Add to Array-Form of Integer"" (Problem 989): Adding a single integer to an array-form integer, which could be generalized to the addition of two array-form integers.

Understanding how to manually handle arithmetic operations at a digit level in arrays or strings is crucial to solving these types of problems effectively."
67,"LeetCode Problem 67 is titled ""Add Binary,"" which is a problem in the domain of string manipulation and binary arithmetic. Let's break down the problem statement and dive deep into how to solve it.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The ""Add Binary"" problem asks you to take two binary strings `a` and `b` as inputs and return their sum, also as a binary string. The binary strings are non-empty and contain only characters '1' or '0'.

Here are some important nuances to consider:
- The input strings are not guaranteed to be of the same length. This means we might need to handle the ""carry"" when the lengths of the strings differ.
- Since we're working with binary numbers, we need to remember that adding two '1's produces a '0' with a '1' carried over to the next significant bit.
- The problem should be solved without using built-in functions to convert binary strings to integers and vice versa.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
The solution strategy essentially follows the algorithm for adding two binary numbers, similar to how we do basic arithmetic addition.

Here is one way to approach it:
1. Start from the rightmost bits (least significant bits) of both strings.
2. Add the bits together one pair at a time, taking care to include any carry from the previous addition.
3. If one string is shorter, consider its missing bits as '0'.
4. Continue this process until all bits of both strings have been processed.
5. If there is a carry left after the last operation, add an additional bit with '1' to the result.

One method that can be helpful is to pad the shorter string with leading zeros to match the length of the longer string, simplifying the addition process as you can be assured both strings have equal lengths.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
We will iterate over the two strings from right to left, adding corresponding bits and tracking the carry. Here is how the code may look like:

```python
def addBinary(a, b):
    # Initialize result and carry
    result = []
    carry = 0
    
    # Pad the shorter string with zeros
    a, b = a.zfill(max(len(a), len(b))), b.zfill(max(len(a), len(b)))
    
    # Iterate over both strings from right to left
    for i in range(len(a) - 1, -1, -1):
        # Convert string bits to integers and add them, along with the carry
        total = carry + int(a[i]) + int(b[i])
        # The new bit is total modulo 2
        result.append(str(total % 2))
        # The new carry is total divided by 2
        carry = total // 2
    
    # If there's a carry left, add it to the result
    if carry != 0:
        result.append(str(carry))
    
    # The result should be reversed, as we started from the least significant digit
    return ''.join(reversed(result))
```

Let's go line by line:
- We initiate `result` as an empty list to store the resultant bits, and `carry` as 0.
- We use `.zfill()` method to pad the shorter string with leading zeros to match the lengths; this ensures that we can simply iterate over the bits without checking string lengths at each step.
- We iterate backward over the strings' lengths using a `for` loop and `range`.
- For each bit position, we add the corresponding bits and the carry, converting them from strings to integers.
- We compute the new bit by taking `total % 2` and append it to the result.
- We update the carry by integer-dividing the total by 2, `total // 2`.
- After the loop, we add a remaining carry if it exists.
- We join the reversed result list into a string and return it.

### Elaborate Examples:
Let's walk through an example where `a = ""1010""` and `b = ""1011""`:
```
           1  (carry)
    1010  (a)
+   1011  (b)
---------
   10101  (result)
```
So the function should return ""10101"".

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(n), because we iterate through the strings once, where n is the maximum length of the two strings.
- Space Complexity: O(n), the space needed for the resulting binary string, which in the worst case is one bit longer than the input strings.

### Real-World Applications:
The binary addition algorithm has numerous real-world applications, such as in digital circuit design, computer arithmetic, and various algorithms that involve binary operations.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- Not handling the different lengths of input strings can easily lead to errors. Padding with zeros simplifies this.
- Forgetting to add the last carry can also lead to incorrect results.
- Reverse the result at the end, as we build the result string from the least significant bit to the most.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
The pattern here is ""two-pointer"" or ""simultaneous iteration"", often used when you need to work with two sequences at the same time.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:

68,"LeetCode Problem #68 is titled ""Text Justification"". This problem is a classic example of string manipulation and formatting. Let's break down the problem, analyze the specifics, and then move into an in-depth discussion of how to approach a solution.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem statement gives us a list of words and a maxWidth, which is the length that every line of the resulting text should have. The task is to format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters, and is fully (left and right) justified.

Key points to consider:

- You should pack as many words as you can in each line.
- Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.
- Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible.
- If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the ones on the right.
- For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.
- A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
- Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
- The input array words contains at least one word.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

The solution to this problem involves careful iteration over the input list of words and assembling lines one at a time until all words have been processed. The following steps can be used to create a solution:

1. Initialize an empty list to hold the justified lines (`justified_lines`).
2. Iterate over the words, keeping track of the current line length.
3. For each word, decide whether to add it to the current line or to justify the current line and start a new one.
4. When the maximum width is reached or exceeded, justify the line by distributing spaces:
   - Calculate the total number of spaces needed.
   - Distribute the spaces evenly between words, handling the case where the distribution is not even.
5. Handle the last line differently, as it should be left-justified.
6. Return the list of justified lines.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

The Python code will be explained in detail, but let's write the solution first.

### Elaborate Examples:

The function will be tested with various examples after the code explanation, including edge cases such as a single very long word on one line, multiple short words, and the last line being treated differently.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

After the examples have been worked through, a detailed complexity analysis of both time and space will be made. We'll examine the number of operations relative to the input size and the memory consumption.

### Real-World Applications:

Text justification is a common task in word processing software, typesetting, and web design, where aesthetic and readability are important. It can also be found in terminal-based interfaces and printing software.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

Common pitfalls involve mishandling edge cases, such as the last line, or miscalculating space distribution. It's important to rigorously test the code with various inputs to ensure that all cases are correctly handled.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem can be categorized under string manipulation, formatting, and simulation. Recognizing how to traverse the input and simulate the justification process is key to solving the problem.

Now, let's proceed with implementing and describing the solution in Python."
69,"LeetCode problem number 69 is ""Sqrt(x)"", which asks for the implementation of the `sqrt` function. The task is to compute and return the square root of a non-negative integer `x`. Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The challenge with this problem is to find the square root of an integer without using any built-in exponential functions or operators. This means that functions like `math.sqrt` or operations like `**0.5` are not allowed.

Here is a closer look at the problem details:
- The input is a non-negative integer `x`.
- The output should be the integer part of the square root of `x`. For example, `sqrt(8)` should return `2` and not `2.82842...` since `2` is the integer part of the result.
- If `x` is not a perfect square, the function should floor the square root value to get an integer result.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
There are a few different ways to approach this problem. Let's discuss some of them:

1. **Brute Force Method**: This would involve starting at 1 and squaring each number until the square is greater than `x`. The integer part of the square root would be the previous number. However, this approach is inefficient as it has a time complexity of O(sqrt(x)), which is too slow for large values of `x`.

2. **Binary Search Method**: Since the square root function is monotonically increasing, we can use binary search to find the square root. Start with a left bound of 0 and a right bound of `x`. Then iteratively narrow down the guess in the middle of this range.

3. **Newton's Method**: This is an iterative numerical method that can be used to approximate roots of functions. It can converge faster than binary search but requires a good initial guess and is slightly more complex to implement.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Let's implement the Binary Search method, which is the most common and efficient way to solve this problem.

```python
def mySqrt(x):
    if x < 2:
        return x
    
    left, right = 2, x // 2
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        num = mid * mid
        if num > x:
            right = mid - 1
        elif num < x:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            return mid
    
    return right
```

Breakdown of the code:
- `if x < 2: return x`: A quick check for the base cases 0 and 1. Both of these have square roots equal to themselves.
- `left, right = 2, x // 2`: We start our search between 2 and `x // 2`, as any square root of `x` larger than `x // 2` would square to more than `x`.
- `while left <= right`: This is our binary search loop. We continue searching as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
- `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`: We calculate the middle value. Using `left + (right - left) // 2` instead of `(left + right) // 2` avoids potential overflow.
- `num = mid * mid`: We square the middle value to compare it with `x`.
- `if num > x`: If `num` is greater than `x`, our `mid` is too high, so we adjust our right bound to `mid - 1`.
- `elif num < x`: If `num` is smaller than `x`, our `mid` is too low, so we adjust our left bound to `mid + 1`.
- `else: return mid`: If `num` is exactly `x`, we found an exact square root and return `mid`.
- `return right`: If we exit the while loop without finding an exact square root, `right` will be the floored integer square root of `x`.
