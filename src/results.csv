Problem Number,Output
1,"LeetCode Problem #1 is titled ""Two Sum."" Let's break down the problem statement and explore it in detail.

### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

### Inputs and Outputs
- **Input:**
  - An array of integers, `nums`.
  - An integer, `target`.

- **Output:**
  - An array of two integers, which are the indices of the two numbers in `nums` that add up to `target`.

### Constraints
The problem may also specify some constraints, such as:
1. \( 2 \leq \text{length of } \text{nums} \leq 10^{4} \)
2. \( -10^{9} \leq \text{nums}[i] \leq 10^{9} \)
3. \( -10^{9} \leq \text{target} \leq 10^{9} \)
4. Only one valid answer exists.

### Examples
Here's a simple example to illustrate the problem:

- **Input:** `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9`
- **Output:** `[0, 1]`
- **Explanation:** Since `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.

### Solution Strategy
For this problem, there are multiple approaches, and we will discuss two primary strategies:

#### 1. Brute Force Approach
The brute force approach would involve using two loops to go through each pair of numbers and checking if they add up to the target.

- Time complexity: \(O(n^2)\)
- Space complexity: \(O(1)\)

This method is not efficient for large lists because it checks every combination of numbers.

#### 2. Hash Map Approach
A more efficient approach is to use a hash map (or dictionary in Python) to store and quickly access the required complement for each number.

- Time complexity: \(O(n)\)
- Space complexity: \(O(n)\)

This method is much more efficient because it allows us to look up the complement in constant time.

### Python Code Explanation
Let's dive into the Python code using the hash map approach for this problem:

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    # Create an empty dictionary to store the potential complements
    num_dict = {}
    
    # Iterate through the list of numbers
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        # Calculate the necessary complement to reach the target
        complement = target - num
        
        # Check if the complement is already in the dictionary
        if complement in num_dict:
            # If so, return the indices of complement and current number
            return [num_dict[complement], i]
        
        # If not, store the index of the current number with its value as the key
        num_dict[num] = i
        
    # If no solution is found (this would not happen in this case as per the problem statement),
    # we should raise an exception or handle it in some way, but here it is just a placeholder for completeness.
    return None
```
- `num_dict` is used to store value-index pairs.
- `enumerate(nums)` allows us to loop over `nums` while having access to both the value (`num`) and the index (`i`).
- The `complement` is the difference between `target` and `num`.
- We check if this `complement` exists in `num_dict`. If it does, it means we have previously seen this complement's counterpart (which together with the current number adds up to the target). We return the pair of indices.
- If not, we store `num` along with its index in the dictionary for potential future complement checks.

### Complexity Analysis
Using the hash map approach:

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) because we traverse the list containing `n` elements only once. Each lookup in the table costs only \(O(1)\) time.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) in the worst case, all the elements are stored in the hash map, which contains exactly `n` elements.

### Practical Applications
This problem models a fundamental concept in computer science known as the ""search for pair with a specific sum,"" which has various applications such as:
- Finding pairs of products that fit within a budget.
- Matching tasks in a project to meet a strict deadline based on the sum of their estimated times.
- In financial algorithms for identifying two trades which together meet a target profit or loss.

### Potential Errors and Tips
- Remember to check if the complement is the number itself and that you're not using the same element twice.
- Pay attention to the possibility of negative numbers and zero.
- Always consider that dictionary lookups are fast but not instantaneous; in cases of large datasets, even \(O(n)\) may be too slow.

2,"LeetCode problem number 2 is titled ""Add Two Numbers."" It's a classic problem in the category of linked lists, and it tests your understanding of linked list manipulation, carrying over digits, and basic arithmetic operations in the context of data structures.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The problem states that you are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. You are asked to return a linked list representing the sum of the two numbers.

The problem statement is detailed as follows:
- The linked lists are non-empty.
- The numbers represented by the nodes are non-negative.
- The digits are stored in reverse order, meaning the 1's digit is at the head of the list.
- Each node may only contain a single digit.
- You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

The inputs are provided as two linked lists, and the definition for singly linked lists is usually provided like this:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
```

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
To solve this problem, you can simulate the process of addition as you would on paper. You iterate through both linked lists from the head to the tail, adding corresponding digits along with any carry-over from the previous digit's addition.

Here's the general algorithm:
1. Initialize a new dummy head for the result linked list.
2. Initialize a pointer (`cur`) for traversal, starting at the dummy head.
3. Initialize a variable (`carry`) to keep track of the carry-over, starting at 0.
4. Loop through lists `l1` and `l2` until both are `None`. For each step:
    - Compute the sum of the current digits (`l1.val`, `l2.val`) and the `carry`.
    - The new digit to be inserted into the result list would be `sum % 10`.
    - The new carry will be `sum // 10`.
    - Move `l1` and `l2` to their next node if they are not `None`.
5. If thereâ€™s a carry left after the iteration ends, create a new node with that carry and append it to the result list.
6. Return the node following the dummy head, which would be the beginning of the actual result list.

This approach ensures that both lists are processed simultaneously, and if one list is shorter, we only use the carry for the remaining part of the longer list. The `dummy head` technique simplifies code and helps to handle edge cases cleanly, such as when a new digit needs to be added after the last digit (e.g., 999 + 1).

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Let's now translate the algorithm into a Python function:

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode()
        cur = dummy
        carry = 0

        while l1 or l2 or carry:
            v1 = l1.val if l1 else 0
            v2 = l2.val if l2 else 0
            # Calculate the sum of the two digits and the carry
            val = v1 + v2 + carry
            carry = val // 10  # Update the carry
            cur.next = ListNode(val % 10)  # Create a new node with the modulo result
            cur = cur.next  # Move to the next node

            # Move to the next nodes in l1 and l2
            if l1:
                l1 = l1.next
            if l2:
                l2 = l2.next

        # If there's still a carry after processing both lists, add a new node.
        if carry:
            cur.next = ListNode(carry)

        return dummy.next  # Return the next node after the dummy because the dummy is not part of the actual result
```

In this code snippet, `dummy` is a placeholder node that makes it easier to return the head of the new list once the algorithm finishes. The `cur` variable is a pointer that traverses the result list, appending new digits as needed. The while loop continues until both `l1` and `l2` have been fully processed and there is no carry value left.

### Elaborate Examples:
Consider two linked lists for the numbers 247 and 564 (stored in reverse as 742 and 465):

```
l1: 2 -> 4 -> 7
l2: 5 -> 6 -> 4
Result: 7 -> 0 -> 2 -> 1  # 247 + 564 = 811
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
- Time complexity: O(max(n, m)), where n and m are the lengths of `l1` and `l2` respectively. This is because we're processing the elements of the linked lists in a single pass.
- Space complexity: O(max(n, m)). The length of the new list is at most max(n, m) + 1 (because of a possible carry at the highest order).

### Real-World Applications:
This problem is a representation of arithmetic operations with large numbers that cannot be held in standard data types like integer or long. In cryptographic algorithms, financial calculations, or scientific computations, similar techniques are used to handle large number operations.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- Remember to handle the carry when it is not zero at the end of list traversal.
- Take into account that linked lists can be of different lengths.
- Be careful to handle the case where one of the lists becomes None before the other.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem follows a pattern of linked list manipulation and arithmetic operations. Understanding how to traverse linked lists while performing simultaneous operations is key to solving similar problems.

3,"Problem number 3 on LeetCode is known as ""Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters"". Let's break down the problem in detail.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The problem asks you to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters given a string `s`. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. 

Here are a few nuances of the problem:
- The input string can consist of any characters in the range of printable ASCII characters, which includes letters, digits, punctuation, and whitespace.
- A substring containing no repeat characters can be just a single character in length if all characters in the string are the same.
- The solution should find not just any substring but the longest possible one without repeated characters.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
To solve this problem, you could consider multiple approaches:

**Brute Force Approach:**
The brute force method would involve checking all possible substrings and verifying if they contain no repeating characters, updating the maximum length as you go. However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n^3), which is highly inefficient for large strings.

**Sliding Window Technique:**
A more efficient method is the sliding window technique. This approach maintains a window that expands or shrinks as it scans through the string. If a character not in the window is found, the window expands and includes this character. If a repeated character is detected, the window shrinks from the left until the repeat is removed. A hash set or hash map can be employed to keep track of the characters currently in the window and their positions. This technique improves the time complexity significantly.

**Optimized Sliding Window with HashMap:**
The optimized sliding window approach uses a HashMap to remember the last index of every character we have seen. Instead of shrinking the window one character at a time, you can directly skip all the elements in the range and start from the next index after the repeated character.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Now let's write a Python function to demonstrate the optimized sliding window approach:

```python
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s):
    char_map = {}
    longest = 0
    left = 0

    for right, char in enumerate(s):
        if char in char_map and char_map[char] >= left:
            left = char_map[char] + 1
        char_map[char] = right
        longest = max(longest, right - left + 1)

    return longest
```

In this function:
- We initialize a dictionary `char_map` to store characters and their last seen index.
- `longest` keeps track of the length of the longest substring found.
- `left` is the starting index of our current window, and `right` is the end index.
- We then iterate through the string with an index `right` and character `char`.
- If `char` is in `char_map` and the last seen index is greater than or equal to `left`, it means we found a repeating character, and we need to update `left` to be one index after the last seen index of that character.
- We update `char_map` with the current index for `char`.
- We update `longest` with the maximum of its current value and the length of the current window.

### Elaborate Examples:
For example, if the input string is `""abcabcbb""`, the longest substring without repeating characters is `""abc""`, which has a length of 3.

When the input string is `""bbbbb""`, the longest substring is just `""b""`, with a length of 1 because all characters are the same.

And if the input string is `""pwwkew""`, the function will find ""wke"" or ""kew"" as the longest substring without repeating characters, with a length of 3.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
Regarding time complexity, the sliding window approach has O(n) complexity, where n is the length of the string. This is because each character is visited once by the `left` and `right` pointers. The space complexity is O(min(m, n)), where m is the character set size (in this case, the size of the ASCII character set, which is constant) and n is the size of the string, because we need to store the last index of each character that has been seen.

### Real-World Applications:
This problem can represent real-world scenarios where you need to look for maximum uniqueness within a sequence, like analyzing DNA sequences for the longest strand without repeating nucleotides or searching through logs for the longest sequence of unique entries.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
A common pitfall might be to forget to check whether the last seen index of a character is within the current window. Another pitfall is not correctly updating the length of the longest window.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
The pattern here is a sliding window, which is useful in array/string problems where you're asked to find the longest/shortest subarray or substring that satisfies certain conditions.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:
Related problems that can be solved with a similar sliding window technique include:
- LeetCode #159 ""Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters""
- LeetCode #340 ""Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters""
- LeetCode #76 ""Minimum Window Substring""

All these problems involve string manipulation and a variation of the sliding window approach, where maintaining a window based on certain criteria is the central strategy."
4,"LeetCode problem number 4 is titled ""Median of Two Sorted Arrays"". It's a hard-level problem and one of the core problems to understand for coding interviews. Let's break down the problem statement, solution strategies, and Python-specific features that could be utilized to solve this problem.

### Problem Breakdown:

The challenge here is to find the median of two sorted arrays. Here's the precise problem statement:

Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

#### Constraints & Nuances:
- You may assume `nums1` and `nums2` cannot be both empty.
- `nums1` and `nums2` each consist of only unique elements.
- `nums1` and `nums2` may have different lengths.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

The brute force approach to solving this problem would be to merge the two sorted arrays and then find the median of the merged array. This approach, however, would have a time complexity of O(m+n), which goes against the requirement to have a run time of O(log (m+n)).

To optimize the solution, we need to think in terms of binary search. The median is the middle point in a sorted array (or the average of the two middle points if the array length is even), which gives us some critical insights:

- If we have to find a median of two sorted arrays combined, it implies that if we take the left half of the merged array, it should contain exactly half of the total elements.
- Therefore, we can apply a binary search algorithm to find a point in both arrays, such that the left side of the combined array has exactly half of the elements.

This involves ""partitioning"" both arrays such that the left side contains the correct number of elements. The actual median will depend on whether the total number of elements (m+n) is odd or even. 

The core idea here is that if `B` is chosen from both `nums1` and `nums2` such that `len(left_part) == len(right_part)`, then `max(left_part) <= min(right_part)`. Here, `left_part` includes the elements from both arrays that are on the left side of the partition.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

```python
def findMedianSortedArrays(nums1, nums2):
    # If nums1 is larger than nums2, swap them so binary search will be on the smaller array.
    if len(nums1) > len(nums2):
        nums1, nums2 = nums2, nums1
    
    x, y = len(nums1), len(nums2)
    low, high = 0, x
    
    while low <= high:
        partitionX = (low + high) // 2
        partitionY = (x + y + 1) // 2 - partitionX
        
        # Handling edge cases where partition is at the start or end of the array
        maxX = float('-inf') if partitionX == 0 else nums1[partitionX - 1]
        maxY = float('-inf') if partitionY == 0 else nums2[partitionY - 1]
        
        minX = float('inf') if partitionX == x else nums1[partitionX]
        minY = float('inf') if partitionY == y else nums2[partitionY]
        
        # If we have partitioned the arrays correctly, i.e., elements on the left side of the partition are less than those on the right.
        if maxX <= minY and maxY <= minX:
            # Check if combined array is of even or odd length.
            if (x + y) % 2 == 0:
                return (max(maxX, maxY) + min(minX, minY)) / 2
            else:
                return max(maxX, maxY)
        
        # Adjust the partitions based on the comparison between maxX and minY.
        elif maxX > minY:
            high = partitionX - 1
        else:
            low = partitionX + 1

    raise ValueError(""Input arrays were not sorted."")
```

This code performs binary search on the smaller array (after potentially swapping the input arrays to ensure that). The objective of the binary search is to find a suitable partition between the two arrays.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's say we have two arrays: nums1 = [1, 3, 8] and nums2 = [7, 9, 10, 11]. The total number of elements is 7, which is odd. We find the partitions such that:

- `left_part` would have (3+4+1)//2 = 4 elements
- `right_part` would have (3+4)//2 = 3 elements

Binary search helps us do this partition efficiently. We then check the edge values around the partitions to ensure we've partitioned correctly (i.e., that each element in nums1's left partition is less than or equal to each element in nums2's right partition, and vice versa), and then calculate the median based on the parity of the total number of elements.

### Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: O(log(min(m,n))) since we are applying binary search on the smaller array.
- Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space, except for variable storage.

### Real-World Applications:

Finding medians is a common requirement in statistics and data analytics, where you want to figure out the middle value or central tendency of a dataset. Fast median finding algorithms are crucial in scenarios where data is huge, and performance is criticalâ€”like in finance, research, or real-time analytics.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Make sure to handle the edge cases where the partition is at the very start or end of an array.
- Remember that precision matters when dealing with division and handling odd vs. even length combined arrays.
- Understand the usage of sentinel values like `float('-inf')` and `float('inf')` to avoid index out-of-bound errors.
- Error check - throw an exception if the input is not as expected.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

Recognizing that we are dealing with a form of binary search on two sorted arrays is the key to unlocking the efficient solution to this problem. Binary search is a common technique used to achieve logarithmic time complexity.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:

Several other LeetCode problems involve binary search or deal with finding statistical measures in a sorted context, such as:
- ""Find Kth Smallest Pair Distance"" (LeetCode 719)
- ""Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix"" (LeetCode 378)
- ""Find K-th Smallest Prime Fraction"" (LeetCode 786)

Learning to solve the ""Median of Two Sorted Arrays"" lays a foundation for tackling these problems as well, as they share similar themes involving binary search over sorted structures."
5,"LeetCode Problem Number 5 is titled ""Longest Palindromic Substring."" This problem is a classic question that falls under the category of dynamic programming and string manipulation. Let's break down this problem in detail.

### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the longest palindromic substring in `s`. You may assume that the maximum length of `s` is 1000.

A palindrome is a word or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward, for example, ""madam"" or ""racecar"".

### Example

```
Input: ""babad""
Output: ""bab"" or ""aba""
```

Note that ""aba"" is also a valid answer.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The primary challenge here is not only to check if a substring is a palindrome, which is a straightforward process but to find the longest one within the entire string. This involves exploring various substrings and possibly even considering each character as the potential center of a palindrome.

Several subtle aspects might affect the solution:
- Palindromes can be of even or odd length (e.g. ""abba"" is even, ""aba"" is odd). We must account for both cases when searching for palindromes.
- There are \( O(n^2) \) possible substrings in a string of length `n`. However, not all substrings need to be checked if we use efficient algorithms.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

Several approaches can be used to solve this problem:

1. **Brute Force**:
   Try every possible substring and check if it's a palindrome. While this solution is easy to come up with, it is not efficient, with \( O(n^3) \) time complexity due to \( O(n^2) \) possible substrings and \( O(n) \) time to check for palindrome for each substring.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   Store results of palindrome checks in a 2D table, where `dp[i][j]` is `True` if the substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome. This comes down to filling the table based on previously filled entries, which is more efficient than the brute force approach but still has a time complexity of \( O(n^2) \) and space complexity of \( O(n^2) \). 

3. **Expand Around Center**:
   For each character (or pair of characters, for even-length palindromes), expand outward and check for palindromes. This approach significantly reduces the space complexity, using \( O(1) \) additional space, while maintaining the \( O(n^2) \) time complexity, which is generally acceptable for this problem.

4. **Manacher's Algorithm**:
   A more complex but linear-time algorithm that finds the longest palindromic substring in \( O(n) \) time. It is not usually expected in an interview setting due to its complexity.

The ""Expand Around Center"" approach is often preferred in interviews due to its optimal space complexity and good time complexity balance, as well as the simplicity of the code. We'll follow this method.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's write the code for the ""Expand Around Center"" method:

```python
def longestPalindrome(s: str) -> str:
    def expand_around_center(left, right):
        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
            left -= 1
            right += 1
        return s[left + 1:right]

    longest_palindrome = """"
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Odd length palindrome
        palindrome1 = expand_around_center(i, i)
        if len(palindrome1) > len(longest_palindrome):
            longest_palindrome = palindrome1
        
        # Even length palindrome
        palindrome2 = expand_around_center(i, i + 1)
        if len(palindrome2) > len(longest_palindrome):
            longest_palindrome = palindrome2

    return longest_palindrome
```

- We define a helper function `expand_around_center` that takes two indices, `left` and `right`, and expands outwards, checking for palindromes. It returns the longest palindrome found between the two indices.
- Then we iterate over every character of the string `s`, considering each one as the center of a potential odd-length palindrome. We also consider the center of each adjacent pair of characters for even-length palindromes.
- After finding the potential palindromes, we compare their lengths with the current longest palindrome and update the longest palindrome if necessary.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's apply this algorithm to a few examples:

Example 1:
```
Input: ""babad""
Output: ""aba"" or ""bab""
```
When `i` is at index 1 ('a'), the odd-length palindrome ""aba"" is found. In another loop iteration, when `i` is at index 0 ('b'), the even-length palindrome ""bab"" is found. Both are valid longest palindromes.

Example 2:
```
Input: ""cbbd""
Output: ""bb""
```
When iterating, we find two 'b's next to each other and determine the longest even-length palindrome is ""bb"".

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The `expand_around_center` function is called twice for every character: once for the odd-length center and once for the even-length center. The expanding process can take up to `O(n)` time in the worst case (when the entire string is a palindrome), leading to a total time complexity of \( O(n^2) \).

Space complexity is \( O(1) \) because we are only using a finite number of variables to store the current longest palindrome and do not use any additional data structures that scale with the input size.

### Real-World Applications

The Longest Palindromic Substring problem has applications in text analysis, bioinformatics (e.g., DNA sequence analysis), and any domain where pattern recognition in sequences is required.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

When writing the solution, ensure that you correctly update the longest palindrome when a new longer palindrome is found and handle the single-character string edge case. Moreover, remember to handle both odd and even cases separately.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem is an example of the **Two Pointers** method combined with **Palindrome Recognition**. Recognizing palindromes is a common subpattern in string algorithms, and this approach can be adapted for related problems where palindromic properties are relevant.

The problem requires reorganizing a given string into a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows, and then reading off the characters line by line. A zigzag pattern here is defined as follows:

- Start from the top-left corner,
- Write characters vertically downwards on each column until you hit the bottom row,
- Then start moving upwards diagonally to the right (like backwards ""Z""), and continue until you reach the top row,
- Repeat this pattern until you have written all characters.

For example, if you have the string `PAYPALISHIRING` and you are asked to convert it to a zigzag pattern on 3 rows, it would look like this:

```
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
```

After writing the text in such a zigzag pattern, the idea is to then read the text sequentially, row by row, and return the result. For the given example, the output would be `PAHNAPLSIIGYIR`.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

Several approaches can be used to solve this problem:

1. **Simulation:** You can simulate the process of writing the zigzag pattern by tracking the current row and direction (up or down). Initialize a list of strings, one for each row, then iterate over the input string's characters, adding each character to the appropriate row based on the current position, and change the direction when you reach the top or bottom row.

2. **Mathematical Calculation:** A more complex, but potentially more efficient method would consist of calculating the positions of the characters directly, without simulating the whole process. This requires a good understanding of how characters in the original string map to the characters in the zigzag pattern.

The first method is simpler and more intuitive and hence will be our approach of choice.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Here is how a Python solution using the simulation approach might look like:

```python
def convert(s: str, numRows: int) -> str:
    # When numRows is 1 or s is shorter than numRows, no zigzag conversion is needed.
    if numRows == 1 or numRows >= len(s):
        return s
    
    # Initialize an array of strings for each row
    rows = [''] * numRows
    current_row = 0
    going_down = False
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for c in s:
        rows[current_row] += c  # Add the character to the current row
        # If we are on the top or bottom row, change direction
        if current_row == 0 or current_row == numRows - 1:
            going_down = not going_down
        # Update the current row index based on the direction
        current_row += 1 if going_down else -1
            
    # Combine all rows to get the final string
    return ''.join(rows)
```

Now, let's break down the above code:

- First, we handle the edge cases where `numRows` is `1` or `numRows` is greater than or equal to the length of `s`. In both cases, the zigzag conversion doesn't change the original string, so we return `s` as it is.

- We then initialize a list `rows` with `numRows` empty strings. Each string will eventually contain the characters from its corresponding row in the zigzag pattern.

- We also initialize `current_row` to 0 and a flag `going_down` to `False` to keep track of our direction as we go through the string.

- We iterate over each character `c` in `s`, appending it to the correct string in `rows`.

- We switch the direction by toggling `going_down` whenever we reach the top row (`current_row == 0`) or the bottom row (`current_row == numRows - 1`).

- The `current_row` is adjusted accordingly, incrementing it if we're going down and decrementing it if we're going up.

- Finally, we join all of the strings in `rows` to form the final zigzagged string.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's see how this solution handles another example. Consider `s = ""HELLO"" and numRows = 2`. The zigzag pattern would look like this:

```
H   L
E L O
```

The output would be `HLELO`, which is the concatenation of the characters in the rows.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of the simulation approach is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. We iterate over each character exactly once and perform constant time operations for each character.

The space complexity is also O(n), since we are storing the zigzagged string which, in the worst case, will have as many characters as the input string.

### Real-World Applications:

This problem can be seen as a text formatting issue, which is a common task in data presentation and user interfaces. In some contexts, reordering characters or data points in an unconventional pattern may be required to meet certain aesthetic or functional requirements.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Ensuring that you correctly handle when the current row is the first or last row is crucial to avoid out-of-bound errors.
- While appending characters to the strings in `rows`, do not forget to handle the edge cases mentioned earlier.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem can be identified as a simulation problem, where we simulate a process to arrive at the result instead of performing direct mathematical computation. Recognizing this pattern is helpful in approaching other problems that require simulating a process or following a certain pattern.

7,"LeetCode Problem Number 7 is titled ""Reverse Integer."" Here is an in-depth analysis of the problem, the solution strategies, and an expert-level explanation on how to solve it using Python.

### Problem Description

Given a 32-bit signed integer, your task is to reverse the digits of the integer.

#### Constraints:
- The input is assumed to be a 32-bit signed integer. Your function should return 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

The challenge tests your ability to manipulate numbers, handle edge cases, and take into consideration the limitations of fixed-size integer representations in programming languages.

### Detailed Problem Breakdown

The problem seems straightforward but has a few subtleties:
1. **Overflow**: The 32-bit signed integer range is -2^31 to 2^31 - 1. If reversing the integer causes it to fall outside of this range, you must return 0.
2. **Negative Integers**: The problem does not specify it explicitly, but you will need to handle negative integers as well.
3. **Edge Cases**: Numbers ending with zero or very large numbers that are on the edge of overflow when reversed need careful handling.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

#### Approach 1: Pop and Push Digits & Check before Overflow
We can ""pop"" the last digit of the number by taking the modulo (remainder operation) with 10, and ""push"" it onto the reversed number by multiplying the reversed number by 10 and adding the popped digit to it. However, before pushing it there is the need to check if the operation would cause an overflow.

##### Steps:
1. Initialize `reversed_num` to 0.
2. Loop until the number is not 0.
   a. Pop the last digit off the original number using modulo operation.
   b. Check if pushing the digit into `reversed_num` would cause an overflow.
   c. Push the digit onto `reversed_num`.
3. Check if the final `reversed_num` is within the 32-bit signed integer range.
4. Return the `reversed_num`.

**Edge Cases Handling**:
- To handle negative numbers, we can take the absolute value of the number and then multiply the result by -1 if the original number was negative.
- Before every push onto the `reversed_num`, check if the current `reversed_num` is greater than INT_MAX/10 or less than INT_MIN/10 since this will guarantee overflow when multiplied by 10.

#### Approach 2: Convert to String and Reverse
Python provides high-level constructs that can make this process much shorter by utilizing string manipulation:
1. Convert the integer to a string.
2. Reverse the string using slicing.
3. Convert the reversed string back to an integer.
4. Ensure resulting integer is within the 32-bit signed integer range.

**Edge Cases Handling**:
- We can deal with negative numbers by reversing only the digits (ignoring the sign) and later adding the sign back.
- Convert the reversed string to int and immediately check if it's in the valid range.

##### Why use Approach 1 over Approach 2?
Approach 1 is more general and does not rely on language-specific features, thereby showing deeper understanding of the problem. Approach 2 is more Pythonic but may not be directly transferable to a language without the same string manipulation capabilities.

#### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's implement Approach 1 in Python with detailed explanation for each part of the code. The code will use `math` module to obtain the `INT_MAX` and `INT_MIN` values.

```python
import math

def reverse(x: int) -> int:
    INT_MAX = 2**31 - 1
    INT_MIN = -2**31
    
    reversed_num = 0
    sign = 1 if x > 0 else -1
    
    # Take the absolute value to simplify the reversal process
    x = abs(x)
    
    while x != 0:
        pop = x % 10
        x //= 10
        
        # Check if the reversed_num will overflow when multiplied by 10.
        if reversed_num > INT_MAX // 10 or (reversed_num == INT_MAX // 10 and pop > 7):
            return 0
        if reversed_num < INT_MIN // 10 or (reversed_num == INT_MIN // 10 and pop < -8):
            return 0
        
        # Push the popped digit to reversed_num
        reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + pop
    
    return sign * reversed_num
```

Line by Line:
- We define `INT_MAX` and `INT_MIN` to represent the maximum and minimum 32-bit signed integer values.
- `reversed_num` is initialized to 0 to store the reversed integer as we build it.
- We store the sign of the `x` to reapply it at the end since we'll be working with positive numbers only.
- We take the absolute value of `x` to simplify the reversal process.
- In the loop, we keep ""popping"" the last digit from `x` and ""pushing"" it onto `reversed_num`.
- IMPORTANT: We have two crucial checks for overflow before we push the digit onto `reversed_num`.
- Finally, we return `reversed_num`, applying back the sign.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's take a number: 123

```text
reversed_num = 0 -> Initially

Iteration 1: x = 123
pop = 3
x = 12
reversed_num = 3

Iteration 2: x = 12
pop = 2
x = 1
reversed_num = 32

Iteration 3: x = 1
pop = 1
x = 0
reversed_num = 321

return 321
```

If `x` were negative, say -123, we would first convert it to 123, reverse it as above to obtain 321 and then apply the sign, resulting in -321.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: `O(log(x))`, where `x` is the size of the integer. Since weâ€™re processing each digit individually, the run time is logarithmic to the number of digits in `x`.
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`, as we are using only a fixed amount of extra storage space.

### Real-World Applications

This problem is a good exercise for number manipulation, a common task in software development. It could be relevant in scenarios where numeric data needs to be transformed, such as in signal processing, data formatting, or cryptographic applications.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Forgetting to handle negative numbers can result in incorrect answers.
- Not checking for overflow on each iteration is a common mistake.
- Relying on language-specific features can be a pitfall in interviews where the focus might be on understanding the algorithm rather than the language.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The problem falls under the category of numerical manipulation and simulates common constraints seen in real-world computing, such as integer overflow. Recognizing these patterns helps in applying similar techniques to a wide array of problems where handling overflow or underflow is a concern.

8,"LeetCode problem number 8 is titled ""String to Integer (atoi)"". The problem statement is as follows:

Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

1. Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
2. Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
3. Read in the next characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
4. Convert these digits into an integer (i.e., `""123""` -> `123`, `""0032""` -> `32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
5. If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`.
6. Return the integer as the final result.

Note:
- Only the space character `' '` is considered as whitespace character.
- Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

Let's break down each component of this problem:

### Input:
The input is a string `s` which consists of ASCII characters.

### Output:
The output is a 32-bit signed integer that's the result of the conversion.

### Constraints:
- `0 <= s.length <= 200`
- `s` consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (`0-9`), `' '`, `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'.'`.

### Solution Rationale:
To solve this problem correctly and efficiently, a step-by-step approach is essential, as outlined in the algorithm above. You'll need to iterate through the string `s`, handling whitespaces, optional sign characters, and digits while adhering to the constraints and ensuring the result stays within the 32-bit signed integer range.

### Python Code Explanation:
The solution would involve iterating over the string. Here's how you might write a function in Python to solve this problem:

1. Strip leading whitespaces using `str.lstrip()`.
2. Check for the sign.
3. Read the digit characters and build the integer.
4. Clamp the result if it's out of the 32-bit signed integer range.

Let's write the Python code for this solution and explain it line by line.

```python
def myAtoi(s):
    i, n, sign = 0, len(s), 1  # index, length of string, and sign initialization
    INT_MAX, INT_MIN = 2**31 - 1, -2**31  # Define integer bounds
    
    # Step 1: Ignore leading whitespaces
    while i < n and s[i] == ' ':
        i += 1
    
    # Step 2: Check for the optional sign
    if i < n and (s[i] == '+' or s[i] == '-'):
        sign = -1 if s[i] == '-' else 1
        i += 1
    
    # Step 3: Conversion of number and clamping
    number = 0
    while i < n and s[i].isdigit():
        digit = int(s[i])
        # Check for overflow and clamp if needed
        if number > INT_MAX // 10 or (number == INT_MAX // 10 and digit > INT_MAX % 10):
            return INT_MIN if sign == -1 else INT_MAX
        number = 10 * number + digit
        i += 1
    
    return sign * number
```

In this code snippet, we define two constants, `INT_MAX` and `INT_MIN` to represent the limits of a 32-bit signed integer. We then skip leading whitespaces, check for and apply the sign, read in the digits to form a number, and finally, clamp the number to the appropriate limits if overflow is detected.

### Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because we may have to scan the entire string in the worst case.
- Space Complexity: O(1), since we use a fixed amount of space for variables regardless of input size.

### Practical Applications:
The `atoi` function is commonly used in programming when we need to parse strings to retrieve numeric values, such as reading configuration files, parsing command-line arguments, or processing textual data that contains numerical information.

### Common Pitfalls:
- Forgetting to handle leading whitespaces.
- Not dealing with overflow correctly.
- Missing the check for non-digit characters.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem represents the ""String Parsing"" category, where you need to convert a string into another data type while handling various edge cases.

### Related Problems:

Each of these problems also involves converting or interpreting the contents of strings and dealing with edge cases and input validation, making them good practice for honing string parsing skills."
9,"LeetCode Problem #9 is titled ""Palindrome Number."" The problem statement is as follows:

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Follow up:**
Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

Key aspects of the problem include:
- The input is an integer `x`.
- The goal is to return `true` if `x` is a palindrome and `false` otherwise.
- A palindrome integer reads the same forward and backward.
- Negative numbers are not palindromes because the ""-"" sign does not reverse.
- The follow-up asks to solve the problem without using string conversion (typically string conversion would be an easy way to check for a palindrome).

There are several nuances to consider:
- A single-digit number is always a palindrome.
- The problem with negative numbers is the negative sign, which doesn't have a ""mirror"" on the other end.
- You might need to handle edge cases like integers with trailing zeros, as they cannot be palindromes because leading zeros are not allowed in integers.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

The general strategies for this problem can be divided into two approaches:

1. **String Conversion Approach**: Convert the integer to a string, and check if the string reads the same backward as forward. This can be achieved simply through string slicing.
2. **Mathematical Approach**: Reverse the digits of the number mathematically and compare the original number with the reversed number.

For the follow-up constraint, the mathematical approach is preferred since string conversion is prohibited. This requires reversing half of the number and comparing it with the other half.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Here's a Python function that solves the problem using the mathematical approach:

```python
def isPalindrome(x: int) -> bool:
    # Negative numbers are not palindromes.
    # Also, if the last digit of the number is 0, then to be a palindrome,
    # the first digit of the number also needs to be 0 which is only possible if the number is 0.
    if x < 0 or (x % 10 == 0 and x != 0):
        return False
    
    reversed_number = 0
    while x > reversed_number:
        reversed_number = reversed_number * 10 + x % 10
        x //= 10

    # When the length of the number is an odd number, we can get rid of the middle digit by reversed_number//10
    # For example, when the input is 12321, at the end of the loop we get x = 12, reversed_number = 123,
    # since the middle digit doesn't matter in palindrome, we can simply compare x with reversed_number//10
    return x == reversed_number or x == reversed_number // 10
```

Here's what the code does:

- First, it addresses the fast fail cases: if `x` is negative or ends with 0 (but is not 0), the number is not a palindrome.
- It initializes `reversed_number` to zero. This will build the reversed integer.
- It then enters a loop, which runs only as long as the original number `x` is greater than `reversed_number`. This ensures that we only reverse half of the number.
- During each iteration of the loop, it adds the last digit of `x` to `reversed_number`, multiplies `reversed_number` by 10, and reduces `x` by one digit.
- After the loop, if `x` has an odd number of digits, `reversed_number` will have the middle digit still attached. We remove it using integer division by 10.
- Finally, it compares `x` with `reversed_number` to check if the number is a palindrome.

### Elaborate Examples:

Using the function `isPalindrome` with the examples provided:

- `isPalindrome(121)` would return `true`. It will reverse only the `21` and compare it with `1`, effectively comparing `12` and `12`.
- `isPalindrome(-121)` would return `false` because of the fast fail check for negative numbers.
- `isPalindrome(10)` would return `false` due to the fast fail check for numbers ending with 0 that are not 0.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of the mathematical approach to solve this problem is O(log10(n)) because we are dividing the input by 10 for every iteration.

The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a fixed amount of space (just `reversed_number` and a few other variables), which does not scale with the input size.

### Real-World Applications:

Palindrome detection may seem like a puzzle, but it has various real-world applications, such as error detection in data transmission, bioinformatics (for finding palindromic sequences in DNA), and within algorithms for text editing software.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Forgetting to handle negative inputs and numbers with trailing zeros are common pitfalls.
- Avoiding unnecessary work by only reversing half the number is a useful optimization trick.
- Knowing when to stop (when the original number is less than or equal to the reversed half) is key to solving this problem correctly.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This is a mathematical manipulation problem combined with a digit-by-digit analysis to solve a logic puzzle. Recognizing how palindrome properties can be used to reduce the work (by only considering half of the number) is a central pattern in effective problem-solving for similar challenges.

10,"Problem number 10 on LeetCode is ""Regular Expression Matching"". Here's an extensive breakdown of the problem, the solution, and everything related to it:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The problem presents two strings where the first is a text string `s` and the second is a pattern `p`, and our task is to implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'`. The `'.'` character matches any single character, while `'*'` means zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial). The function signature given is:

```python
def isMatch(s: str, p: str) -> bool:
```

The nuances of this problem lie in the interpretation of the `'*'` character in the context of the preceding character and in handling cases where multiple `'*'` characters are in sequence or where `'*'` follows a `'.'`.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
The regular expression matching problem is typically solved using Dynamic Programming (DP). The idea is to create a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents whether `s[0..i-1]` matches `p[0..j-1]`.

Here are the conditions:
- If `p[j-1]` is a single character, `dp[i][j]` depends on whether `s[i-1]` is the same as `p[j-1]` or `p[j-1]` is `'.'`.
- If `p[j-1]` is `'*'`, we have two sub-cases:
  1. We can ""ignore"" the character and the star (`dp[i][j-2]`).
  2. If the character before `'*'` is a match, we can ""consume"" one instance of that character from the string `s` and compare `dp[i-1][j]`.

The base case for the DP initialization is that an empty string matches an empty pattern (`dp[0][0] = True`), and we need to fill in the rest of the DP table based on the abovementioned rules.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
I will provide a sample Python code and explain the functionality:

```python
def isMatch(s, p):
    m, n = len(s), len(p)
    dp = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = True

    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if p[i - 1] == '*':
            dp[0][i] = dp[0][i - 2]

    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if p[j - 1] == '*':
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 2] or (dp[i - 1][j] and (s[i - 1] == p[j - 2] or p[j - 2] == '.'))
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] and (s[i - 1] == p[j - 1] or p[j - 1] == '.')

    return dp[m][n]
```

- `dp` is a 2D list of boolean values, initially set to False.
- `dp[0][0] = True` because an empty string matches an empty pattern.
- We preprocess the DP table `dp[0][j]` to cover patterns that are made up only of `'*'` characters and their preceding characters.
- The outer loop runs through the text `s`, and the inner loop runs through the pattern `p`.
- Inside the nested loop, we fill `dp` according to whether the current character in pattern `p` is `'*'` or not.

### Elaborate Examples:
Let's consider a few examples:
1. `s = ""aab""` and `p = ""c*a*b""`. There are three parts to the pattern; `c*` can match zero occurrences of 'c', `a*` can match two occurrences of 'a', and `b` matches 'b'. So the result is `True`.
2. `s = ""mississippi""` and `p = ""mis*is*p*.""`. Despite the presence of stars, the final 'p' in the pattern cannot be matched because the string has an additional 'i' after 'p', resulting in `False`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(m * n), where m is the length of the string `s` and n is the length of the pattern `p`, because we need to fill in an m by n DP table.

The space complexity is also O(m * n) for the same reason.

### Real-World Applications:
Regular expression matching is widely used in parsing text, data validation, syntax highlighting, and many other areas that involve pattern matching and text processing.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- Edge cases where the pattern is empty but the string is not, or vice versa, are tricky and could lead to incorrect solutions if not handled properly.
- Patterns ending with `'*'` might match zero or more of any characters, so always consider both possibilities.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
Recognizing that this is a dynamic programming problem is crucial. This pattern involves breaking down the problem into subproblems, solving those subproblems, and then combining them to form a solution to the original problem.

You are given an array `height` of non-negative integers, where each integer represents a point at coordinate `(i, ai)`. `n` vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line `i` is at `(i, ai)` and `(i, 0)`. Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

The function signature is:
```python
def maxArea(height: List[int]) -> int:
```

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
- **Lines Representation:** Each element in the array represents the height of a line on a graph. The index of the element represents its position on the x-axis.
- **Container Concept:** The width of the container is the difference between the indices of two lines, and the height of the container is the minimum of the two lines' heights since water spills over the shorter line.
- **Maximum Area:** The goal is to find two lines that maximize the area of the container, which would be the product of width and height.
  
It is important to note that we are only concerned with vertical lines and horizontal distance. Diagonal distances are not relevant to this problem.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
There are several ways to approach this problem. A brute force method would be to check all possible pairs of lines to find the maximum area. However, this approach has an O(n^2) time complexity and is not efficient for large arrays.

A more efficient approach is the two-pointer technique:
1. Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the array.
2. Calculate the area formed between the two lines at the pointers and update the maximum area if it's larger than what we've seen so far.
3. Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line towards the other pointer by one step because moving the longer line would not possibly increase the area, as the height of the container is limited by the shorter line.
4. Repeat the above step until the two pointers meet.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
Here is how we may implement the two-pointer approach in Python:
```python
def maxArea(height):
    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1  # initializing two pointers
    max_area = 0  # initializing max_area variable
    
    while left < right:  # loop until the pointers meet
        # Calculate the area
        width = right - left  
        area_height = min(height[left], height[right])
        area = width * area_height
        
        # Update max_area if this area is larger
        max_area = max(max_area, area)
        
        # Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
            
    return max_area  # return the max_area found
```

- We start by initializing `left` and `right` pointers, and `max_area` which will store the maximum area found.
- We enter a `while` loop which will run until `left` is no longer less than `right`.
- We calculate the width between pointers and find which line is shorter to calculate the area.
- We then compare the calculated area with the current `max_area` and update it if it's larger.
- We increment the left pointer or decrement the right pointer based on which one is shorter.
- The loop continues until pointers meet and we return `max_area`.

### Elaborate Examples
Let's take a simple example: `height = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]`. Using this approach, we would quickly identify that the maximum area is between the elements `height[1]` (value 8) and `height[8]` (value 7) which gives us an area of 7 (width) * 7 (height) = 49 square units, which is the maximum possible area within this container arrangement.

### Complexity Analysis
**Time Complexity:** O(n). We only need one pass through the array since we narrow down our possibilities with each step by moving one of the pointers.

**Space Complexity:** O(1). No additional data structures are used that depend on the input size.

### Real-World Applications
This problem is a good abstraction for any situation in which an optimal pairing between elements in a list is needed based on some constraint, like maximizing profit based on price and quantity, or optimizing the layout for storage or transportation.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks
- It might be tempting to attempt a nested loop, but that is unnecessary and inefficient.
- Understand that moving the pointer of the taller line inwards cannot result in a larger area.

### Problem Pattern Identification
The problem can be categorized as a two-pointer problem, which is frequently used in array manipulation. Two-pointer problems are often used to find pairs or triplets that satisfy a certain condition in an optimized way.

12,"LeetCode Problem #12 is titled ""Integer to Roman"". This problem is a classical example of a number conversion challenge. Let's first break down the problem statement and then discuss potential solutions with detailed explanations and examples.

## Problem Breakdown:
The task is to convert an integer to a Roman numeral. The problem specifies that the integer (to be converted) is between 1 to 3999 inclusive. In order to solve this problem effectively, it is crucial to understand how Roman numerals work.

Roman numerals are based on the following symbols and their values:

- I (1)
- V (5)
- X (10)
- L (50)
- C (100)
- D (500)
- M (1000)

In Roman numerals, numbers are written by combining symbols and adding their values. For example, the numeral ""III"" represents 1+1+1 which equals 3. However, there is also a subtractive principle at work. For example, ""IV"" represents 5-1, which equals 4. This principle is applied to a numeral that precedes a larger numeral, to denote subtraction.

The subtractive principle is used at certain places to avoid four characters being repeated in succession. Here are some examples:

- IV (4)
- IX (9)
- XL (40)
- XC (90)
- CD (400)
- CM (900)

A number in Roman numerals is basically a sum of letters: you add all the values of all the letters to get the final number. However, if a letter with a lower value precedes a letter with a higher value, it is subtracted.

## In-Depth Solution Rationale:
Converting an integer to Roman numeral involves breaking down the number into its constituent parts and then mapping those parts onto their Roman numeral counterparts. This process is often tackled by creating a dictionary or list of numeral symbols paired with their integer values, starting from the highest to the lowest, including the subtractive combinations.

One starts with the highest Roman numeral values and uses as many as possible, moving to lower values as you go along. You have to ensure that the combination used reflects the largest possible numeral values that total up to the given integer.

## Example:
If you have to convert 58 to Roman numerals:
- Start with the highest numeral less than 58, which is L (50).
- Subtract 50 from 58, which leaves you with 8.
- The highest numeral less than 8 is V (5).
- Subtract 5 from 8, which leaves you with 3.
- Then, you use III to represent 3.
- Finally, you concatenate what you have: L (50) + V (5) + III (3) equals LVIII.

## Python Code Explanation:
```python
def intToRoman(num):
    val = [
        1000, 900, 500, 400,
        100, 90, 50, 40,
        10, 9, 5, 4,
        1
        ]
    syms = [
        ""M"", ""CM"", ""D"", ""CD"",
        ""C"", ""XC"", ""L"", ""XL"",
        ""X"", ""IX"", ""V"", ""IV"",
        ""I""
        ]
    roman_numeral = ''
    i = 0
    while num > 0:
        for _ in range(num // val[i]):
            roman_numeral += syms[i]
            num -= val[i]
        i += 1
    return roman_numeral
```

In the above code, we:
- Initialize lists `val` and `syms` containing pairs of integers and their respective Roman numeral representations.
- Create an empty string `roman_numeral` to build our result.
- Use a `while` loop to continue the process until our input number is reduced to zero.
- Have an inner loop that uses `num // val[i]` to count how many times the current Roman numeral `syms[i]` can fit into `num`. For each fit, it appends the symbol to `roman_numeral` and reduces `num` accordingly.
- Increment `i` to move to the next lower-valued symbol.

The while loop ensures that we only add symbols to `roman_numeral` when `num` is greater than zero, and since we're continuously subtracting from `num`, this ensures that our loop will eventually terminate.

## Complexity Analysis:
The complexity of the conversion depends mainly on the size of the lists `val` and `syms`, which is constant in this case. We can consider the time complexity to be O(1) because the solution does not depend on the size of the input number directly; it only depends on how many times each Roman numeral fits into the number, which has a constant upper bound given the largest numeral is 1000.

The space complexity is also O(1) as we are creating a string to hold the Roman numerals, whose size will not exceed a certain length due to the upper limit of the input number (3999).

## Real-World Applications:
Understanding number systems conversion is important in computer science, especially in contexts where different numeral systems are used. For instance, Roman numerals are used in a variety of applications today, including watch faces, book chapters, movie sequels, and as a stylistic choice in graphic design and artworks.

## Common Pitfalls:
- Forgetting the subtractive cases such as IV for 4 or IX for 9.
- Repeating a symbol more than three times (e.g., writing 'IIII' for 4).

## Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem exemplifies the pattern of mapping - translating one set of symbols or values to another set based on predefined rules. Recognizing and understanding this pattern is helpful in solving various conversion problems and in tasks that involve data formatting and transformation.

## Links to Similar Problems:
- LeetCode #13 ""Roman to Integer"" (the reverse of this problem)
- LeetCode #273 ""Integer to English Words"" (a similar concept of mapping numbers to words)

When approaching similar problems, the strategy of using mapping with predefined rules and systematically decreasing the value to be converted can usually be applied."
13,"LeetCode problem number 13 is `""Roman to Integer""`. The problem statement is as follows:

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 15`
- `s` contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
- It is guaranteed that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.

To solve this problem, one approach is to iterate through the string of roman numerals, convert each symbol to its value, and add it to the total. However, if a smaller value precedes a larger value, we must subtract the smaller value from the total instead of adding it. Let's discuss the solution strategy in more detail.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

#### 1. Mapping Roman Numerals to Integers
The first step is to create a dictionary that maps each Roman numeral symbol to its corresponding integer value, as provided in the problem statement.

#### 2. Translate Roman Numerals to Integer Values
- Initialize a variable to hold the sum of integers corresponding to the Roman numeral.
- Traverse the string from start to end.
- In each iteration, compare the current Roman numeral with the numeral immediately following it.
- If the current numeral is greater than or equal to the next numeral, add its value to the sum.
- If the current numeral is smaller than the next numeral, subtract its value from the sum (since this represents a case like IV or IX).
- If we are at the last numeral, just add its value to the sum since there is no next numeral to compare it with.

#### 3. Return the Result
The sum now contains the integer value of the Roman numeral. Return this value.

### Example:
Let's walk through an example to understand this approach better.

Input: `""MCMXCIV""`

- M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90, IV = 4
- The sum would be 1000 (M) + 900 (CM) + 90 (XC) + 4 (IV) = 1994.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
```python
def romanToInt(s: str) -> int:
    # Create a dictionary to map Roman numerals to integers
    roman_to_int = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}
    
    # Initialize an integer to hold the final result
    total = 0
    
    # Iterate over the string of Roman numerals
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # If we're at the last character, or the current character represents a value greater than or equal to the next one...
        if i == len(s) - 1 or roman_to_int[s[i]] >= roman_to_int[s[i + 1]]:
            total += roman_to_int[s[i]] # ...then add its value to the total.
        else:
            total -= roman_to_int[s[i]] # Otherwise, subtract its value from the total.

    # Return the final result
    return total
```

### Time Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string containing the Roman numeral. This is because we traverse the entire string once.

### Space Complexity Analysis:
The space complexity is O(1), since the dictionary that stores the Roman numeral mappings uses constant space, and the only other variable used is the integer to hold the total value.

### Real-World Applications:
This algorithm can be useful in any domain that requires the conversion of Roman numerals to their integer form, such as in historical documentation analysis, games, educational software, or user interfaces that need to support Roman numerals.

### Common Pitfalls:
Watch out for cases where a smaller numeral comes before a larger numeral, as these require subtraction rather than addition. Make sure to cover the edge cases in the input string, such as an empty string or a string with all numerals in descending order.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem follows the pattern of string traversal and mapping characters to values. Similar problems involve translating from one representation to another using mappings and recognizing special cases in the traversal (like the subtractive notation in Roman numerals).

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:

Some similar LeetCode problems include:
- LeetCode Problem 12: ""Integer to Roman"" (the reverse of this problem).
- LeetCode Problem 273: ""Integer to English Words"" (translating integers to their word representation).
- LeetCode Problem 482: ""License Key Formatting"" (formatting strings based on certain rules).

In each of these problems, mapping values to different representations and careful string traversal are key aspects of the solution, much like in Problem 13."
14,"LeetCode Problem 14 is titled ""Longest Common Prefix"" and it asks for the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. Below, I'll break down the problem in detail and then discuss the solution rationale along with code explanations, examples, complexity analysis, and the broader context.

### Problem Breakdown
The problem provides a list (array) of strings, where each string consists of only lowercase English letters. Your task is to find the longest common prefix (LCP) among all the strings. The LCP for a set of strings is the longest string that is a prefix of every string in the set. A prefix of a string is a substring that starts at the beginning and can include the entire string itself or none of it.

Here are some important conditions and points to note:
- If there is no common prefix, you must return an empty string.
- The strings could be of different lengths.
- The input array can contain any number of strings, and each string can be of any length (within the constraints of the problem).
- You should be looking for the longest common prefix (LCP), not any common prefix.
- The input array might even be empty or have one string, in which cases the LCP is """" and the string itself, respectively.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
To solve this problem, there are several strategies one could employ. I'll discuss a few common ones:

1. **Horizontal Scanning**: Start with the first string in the array as the initial prefix. Then compare this prefix with the next string, and shorten the prefix from the end if necessary until it matches as a prefix to the next string. Do this for all strings in the array. The final prefix is the LCP.

2. **Vertical Scanning**: Imagine the strings as columns and look down each column one by one, comparing characters across all strings in that position. Once you encounter a mismatch, or any string ends, the current accumulated prefix is the LCP.

3. **Divide and Conquer**: Divide the array of strings into two halves. Recursively find the LCP within each half and then combine the two.

4. **Binary Search**: Find the string with the minimum length and binary search its length. Use the midpoint length to check if that prefix works for all strings.

5. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: Construct a trie of all the strings. The LCP is the common path from the root until the shallowest leaf.

A popular and straightforward approach is the **Horizontal Scanning** method since it's easy to understand and implement.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
Let's consider a Python solution using the horizontal scanning approach:

```python
def longestCommonPrefix(strs):
    if not strs:
        return """"
    prefix = strs[0]
    for i in range(1, len(strs)):
        while strs[i].find(prefix) != 0:
            prefix = prefix[:-1]
            if not prefix:
                return """"
    return prefix
```

Here's what each part does:
- First, we check if the input array `strs` is empty. If true, we return an empty string immediately.
- We consider the first string in the array as our initial prefix.
- We iterate over the rest of the strings in the array with a `for` loop, starting from index 1.
- For each string, we check if the current prefix is a prefix of this string by using `find()`. If `find()` returns 0, it means the prefix was found at the start of the string.
- If the current prefix is not a prefix of the string, we reduce the prefix by one character using slicing with `prefix[:-1]`.
- Whenever the prefix is empty or we reduce it to an empty string, we know there's no common prefix, and we return an empty string.
- If we traverse all strings and still have a prefix, we return the prefix which is the LCP.

### Elaborate Examples

Here are some examples of how this function would behave:

```python
# Case 1: Common prefix ""fl""
print(longestCommonPrefix([""flower"", ""flow"", ""flight""]))  # Output: ""fl""

# Case 2: No common prefix
print(longestCommonPrefix([""dog"", ""racecar"", ""car""]))    # Output: """"

# Case 3: All strings are the same
print(longestCommonPrefix([""apple"", ""apple"", ""apple""]))  # Output: ""apple""

# Case 4: Single string in array
print(longestCommonPrefix([""single""]))                   # Output: ""single""

# Case 5: Empty string array
print(longestCommonPrefix([]))                           # Output: """"
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
- **Time complexity**: In the worst case (all strings are the same), every comparison could go up to the length of the first string `m`, for `n` strings. This would lead to a time complexity of O(m*n).
- **Space complexity**: We use only a constant amount of additional space, hence the space complexity is O(1).

### Real-World Applications
The concept of finding a common prefix can be useful in multiple real-world scenarios, such as:
- Autocompletion in search engines or coding IDEs.
- DNA sequence analysis where common sequences have biological significance.
- Filesystem organization or looking for common paths in a list of file locations.
- Grouping products in ecommerce by common attributes (extracted from descriptive strings).

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks
- Overlooking the case where there are no strings in the input array.
- Forgetting to handle edge cases like when strings are of different lengths.
- Trying to compare the entire strings instead of just looking for a prefix.
- Attempting to use an overly complex solution when a simple, direct approach could be applied.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem is an example of string manipulation and pattern searching. Recognizing the pattern of the ""common substring"" type can aid in solving similar problems related to string comparisons and prefix trees.

Each of these problems requires an understanding of string manipulation, searching, or prefix structures and can apply the knowledge gained from solving the Longest Common Prefix problem."
15,"LeetCode problem number 15 is known as ""3Sum."" This problem is a classic example of using two-pointer technique within array processing to identify a set of three integers from an array that sum up to zero.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem statement for ""3Sum"" is as follows:

Given an array `nums` of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in `nums` such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. **Sorting**: First, sort the input array `nums`. Sorting helps us skip duplicate elements efficiently and use the two-pointer technique.

2. **Iterating with Two Pointers**: For each element in the array, we use a two-pointer approach to find the remaining two elements that sum to zero. We set a low pointer just after the current element, and a high pointer at the end of the array. We calculate the sum of current, low, and high elements to check if they add up to zero.

3. **Moving Pointers**: If we find a sum that is too low (less than zero), we move the low pointer to the right to increase the sum. If the sum is too high (more than zero), we move the high pointer to the left to decrease the sum.

4. **Avoiding Duplicates**: After finding each valid triplet, skip all the duplicate values by moving the low and high pointers to their next different values.

5. **Early Stopping**: If the current element is greater than zero, we can stop the iteration early because it's not possible to have three positive numbers add up to zero.

6. **Unique Triplets**: Ensure that the indices of ""a, b, c"" are not the same and the triplet does not already exist in our solution set to maintain uniqueness.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's go through the Python code step by step:

```python
def threeSum(nums):
    nums.sort()  # Sort the array
    result = []  # Initialize the result list
    
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # Skip the duplicate elements
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
            continue
        
        # Two pointers, left and right
        left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
            
            if total < 0:
                left += 1  # Move the left pointer to the right
            elif total > 0:
                right -= 1  # Move the right pointer to the left
            else:
                # Found a triplet
                result.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])
                # Skip duplicates for the left and right pointers
                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]:
                    left += 1
                while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right - 1]:
                    right -= 1
                # Move both pointers after finding a valid triplet
                left += 1
                right -= 1
                
    return result
```

In the above code, first we sort `nums`. Then we iterate through each element, skip duplicates, and apply the two-pointer technique. We move the `left` and `right` pointers depending on whether the current sum is less than or greater than zero. If the sum is zero, we append the triplet to `result` and move both pointers, while skipping over duplicates.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's use an example to demonstrate the process:

Suppose nums is [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4].

After sorting: [-4, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2]

- We start with `i = 0`, and `nums[i] = -4`. The two-pointer sum needs to be 4, which is impossible because the maximum sum we can get is `1 + 2 = 3`. So we move on.
- At `i = 1`, and `nums[i] = -1`. We skip `i = 2` because it is a duplicate.
- `left` starts at `i + 1 (3)` and `right` starts at the end `5`. We compute the sum as `-1 + 0 + 2 = 1`. Since this is greater than zero, we decrement `right`.
- Now, the sum is `-1 + 0 + 1 = 0`. We have found a triplet and add it to the results. Then, we move `left` and `right` to the next non-duplicate elements.

... and so on until we have iterated through the array.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we have one loop iterating through the array (O(n)) and a nested while loop for the two-pointer scan, which also takes O(n) at most for each fixed element from the outer loop. Sorting the array takes O(n log n), which is dominated by the O(n^2) two-pointer search.

Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) if we ignore the space required for the output. The algorithm only uses a few extra variables for keeping pointers and sum calculations. The sorting operation is in-place.

### Real-World Applications:

This problem can represent any situation where we want to find triplets within a data set that satisfy a specific criteria, such as balancing accounts, matching resources, or even in computer graphics for identifying collinear points.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

Common pitfalls include not handling duplicates correctly, which can lead to non-unique triplets in the result. Another pitfall is not considering the sorted nature of the array when moving pointers, which is essential for optimizing the algorithm.

A valuable trick is to use the continuation condition `if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]` to skip over duplicate elements, because continuing the loop without testing will result in repeated triplets.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

The two-pointer technique used in this problem is a common pattern in problems related to arrays and pair/triplet sum problems. Recognizing this pattern is useful for solving similar problems like ""Two Sum,"" ""Container With Most Water,"" ""4Sum,"" etc.

- Problem 1: Two Sum
- Problem 11: Container With Most Water

Each of these problems requires a similar strategy of moving pointers based on the sum condition, and each has its own quirks that require slight variations in the approach."
16,"LeetCode Problem #16 is titled ""3Sum Closest"". Let's tackle this problem step by step.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem 3Sum Closest is a variation of the popular 3Sum problem. Here is the problem statement:

Given an array `nums` of `n` integers and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`. You are to return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

#### Important Aspects to Note:

- The array `nums` can contain negative and positive numbers.
- The length of `nums` is at least 3, which guarantees that there will be at least one possible trio.
- There is only one valid solution, meaning the closest sum is unique.

This problem requires an optimized approach since the naive brute-force method of checking all possible 3-number combinations has a prohibitive time complexity of O(n^3), which will not be acceptable for large inputs.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

The key to solving 3Sum problems efficiently is to use sorting and two-pointer techniques. Here is a strategy to solve the ""3Sum Closest"" problem effectively:

1. **Sorting:** Sort the array `nums`. Sorting enables the two-pointer approach and helps to avoid duplicate combinations.

2. **Iterating and Two-Pointer Approach:** Fix one number and use a two-pointer approach to find the closest sum. Move one pointer from the start (just after the fixed number) and the other pointer from the end towards the middle.

3. **Updating the Closest Sum:** Whenever you find a three-number sum, compare it to the current closest sum. If it's closer to the target, update the closest sum.

4. **Handling Sum and Target Difference:** If the sum is greater than the target, move the end pointer towards the start to try a smaller sum. If the sum is less than the target, move the start pointer towards the end to try a larger sum.

5. **Return the Closest Sum:** After iterating through all potential combinations, return the closest sum found.

This approach efficiently narrows down the possibilities and finds the closest sum without having to explore all combinations.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Here is a Python code implementation for the problem, which I will break down:

```python
def threeSumClosest(nums, target):
    nums.sort()  # Step 1: Sort the array
    closest = float('inf')  # Initialize closest to infinity for comparison

    # Step 2: Two-pointer approach
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            current_sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
            # Step 3: Update closest sum if the current sum is closer to target
            if abs(current_sum - target) < abs(closest - target):
                closest = current_sum

            # Step 4: Move pointers based on comparison with target
            if current_sum < target:
                left += 1
            elif current_sum > target:
                right -= 1
            else:
                return target  # The exact target sum is found

    # Step 5: Return the closest sum after iterating
    return closest
```

Let's break down the code:

- The `nums.sort()` line sorts the input array which is a crucial first step for the two-pointer approach.
- We initialize `closest` with `float('inf')`, which acts as an initial value that will definitely be replaced by an actual sum since any real number is closer to the target than infinity.
- We use a `for` loop to iterate over `nums`, fixing one number at a time, and leaving room for at least two other numbers (`range(len(nums) - 2)`).
- Inside the loop, we initialize `left` and `right` pointers for the two-pointer approach.
- We use a `while` loop to apply the two-pointer approach as long as the `left` pointer does not surpass the `right` pointer.
- We calculate the `current_sum` with the three numbers at indices `i`, `left`, and `right`.
- The `if` statement inside the `while` loop updates the `closest` variable if the `current_sum` is closer to the `target`.
- The following `if-elif-else` construct adjusts the pointers according to how `current_sum` compares to the `target`.
- If the `current_sum` matches the `target`, we can return `target` immediately since it's the closest possible sum.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's consider an example:

Given `nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4]` and `target = 1`, the sorted `nums` would be `[-4, -1, 1, 2]`.

- When `i = 0`, `left = 1` and `right = 3`, `current_sum = -4 + (-1) + 2 = -3`. `closest` is updated to `-3`.
- As we iterate, we find that `-1 + 1 + 2 = 2` is the closest sum to the target `1`. Hence, `2` would be returned.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2):

- Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time.
- The outer `for` loop runs in O(n) time since it iterates over each element once.
- The inner `while` loop in the worst-case runs in O(n) time for each outer loop iteration, because the `left` and `right` pointers can traverse the remaining part of the array in linear time.

The space complexity is O(1):

- No additional space is needed that scales with the input size. Sorting is done in-place, assuming that the sorting algorithm used is an in-place sorting algorithm (like QuickSort or Timsort, which is used in Python's `sort()` method).

### Real-World Applications:

Finding the closest value to a target in a domain is a common problem that applies to fields such as:

- Finance: To find trades or portfolios that come closest to a desired return.
- Data science: To find a data point nearest to a given value in a set.
- Game development: To resolve collisions or pathfinding, finding nearest points is often necessary.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

Common pitfalls include:

- Forgetting to sort the array initially.
- Not handling the update of the closest sum correctly or not initializing it properly.
- Confusing the index and value while updating pointers.

Tricks to keep in mind:

- Early termination if the exact target sum is found.
- Avoiding unnecessary computation by checking if the absolute difference has already been minimized.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

The problem follows a two-pointer pattern combined with an iteration, which is a common technique used to reduce the time complexity in array processing problems that deal with pair or triplet sums.

17,"The LeetCode problem number 17 is titled ""Letter Combinations of a Phone Number."" Let me provide a detailed explanation of the problem, possible solution strategies, and their implementations in Python.

### Problem Statement

Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

The mapping is:
```
2 -> ""abc""
3 -> ""def""
4 -> ""ghi""
5 -> ""jkl""
6 -> ""mno""
7 -> ""pqrs""
8 -> ""tuv""
9 -> ""wxyz""
```

Note that although the above example features lowercase letters, the actual mapping might use any charset in any order, depending on a specific runtime environment.

#### Input

An input is a string `digits` consisting of digits from '2' to '9'.

#### Output

An output is a list of strings representing all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.

### Solution Rationale

This problem is a good example of a combinatorial problem that can be solved using recursion or iterative approaches such as backtracking. The rationale behind using recursion or backtracking is to explore every possible combination of letters derived from the digits provided. Each digit in the input can be mapped to a set of characters, which leads to a branching factor that increases with every digit added.

#### Approach 1: Recursion

The idea is to start with the first digit, map it to its corresponding letters, and recurse for the remainder of the digits string.

1. For each letter that the current digit represents, prepend it to the existing combination.
2. Recurse with the remainder of the digits string until the string is empty, implying that a complete combination has been formed.
3. Collect the complete combinations in a list and return it.

#### Approach 2: Iterative (Backtracking)

Backtracking is a more general-purpose algorithm that can be applied to constraints satisfaction problems. It incrementally builds candidates for the solution and discards candidates (""backtracks"") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

Here's how we can apply backtracking to solve this problem:

1. Begin with an empty current combination.
2. Choose the next available set of letters for the current digit and try to extend the current combination with each letter.
3. If the combination is complete, add it to the results.
4. If not, proceed to the next digit and repeat steps 2-3.
5. If we reach a point where a combination cannot be extended any further (we have included all the digits), we backtrack and try a different letter for the previous digit.

### Python Code Implementation

Let's implement the recursive solution, which is often the most straightforward approach for this kind of problem.

```python
def letterCombinations(digits):
    if not digits:
        return []
    
    phone_map = {
        '2': 'abc',
        '3': 'def',
        '4': 'ghi',
        '5': 'jkl',
        '6': 'mno',
        '7': 'pqrs',
        '8': 'tuv',
        '9': 'wxyz'
    }
    
    def backtrack(index, path):
        if index == len(digits):
            combinations.append(''.join(path))
            return
        for letter in phone_map[digits[index]]:
            path.append(letter)
            backtrack(index + 1, path)
            path.pop()
    
    combinations = []
    backtrack(0, [])
    return combinations
```

### Complexity Analysis

For both the recursive and iterative (backtracking) approaches:

- Time Complexity: O(N * 4^N), where N is the length of the input digits string. This worst-case scenario occurs when all digits map to 4 letters (e.g., `digits = '7777'`). Here, N represents the depth of the recursive tree, and 4^N represents the total number of possible combinations.
- Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the input digits string due to the space used by the recursion call stack. In addition, if we consider the space used to store the output combinations, it will be O(N * 4^N) since that's the maximum number of possible combinations we can have.

### Examples

Let's illustrate this with an example:

For the input digits `23`, the expected output would be `[""ad"",""ae"",""af"",""bd"",""be"",""bf"",""cd"",""ce"",""cf""]`.
Here's why:

- For digit '2', there are three possible letters: ""a"", ""b"", ""c"".
- For digit '3', there are three possible letters: ""d"", ""e"", ""f"".
- We match each letter from digit '2' with each letter from digit '3' and get the combinations.

### Practical Applications

In a real-world application, solving this problem could be akin to an auto-suggestion feature on a mobile phone keyboard, where pressing a number can suggest possible words that can be formed, which could then be used for quick messaging or search within the phone's contact list.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

When implementing a recursive or backtracking solution for combinatorial problems:
- Remember to clean up the state after traversing/recurse (e.g., we did this with `path.pop()` in our backtrack() method).
- Always consider base cases and edge cases, such as empty input, to avoid unnecessary computation.
- Think about the choice of data structure (like using a list for `path`) that can make it easier to manage the state during backtracking operations.

### Related Problems

Similar problems that involve backtracking and recursive strategies include:
- Permutations (LeetCode Problem #46)

These problems also involve exploring a combinatorial space and applying similar solution strategies that manage state and explore candidates exhaustively.

In conclusion, Problem #17 ""Letter Combinations of a Phone Number"" presents a good opportunity for understanding and applying recursive and backtracking algorithms to solve combinatorial problems. By going through the explanation provided, practicing implementing the solutions, and understanding the complexity, you can strengthen your problem-solving skills for these types of challenges."
18,"LeetCode Problem 18 is titled ""4Sum"". Let's break down the problem in minute detail, discuss solution strategies, and then delve into a detailed explanation of the Python code solution.

### Problem Statement:

Given an array `nums` of `n` integers and an integer `target`, you are asked to find all unique quadruplets `[nums[a], nums[b], nums[c], nums[d]]` in the array which gives the sum of `target`. The quadruplets should fulfill the following conditions:

1. 0 â‰¤ a, b, c, d < n
2. a, b, c, and d are distinct.
3. nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] + nums[d] == target

You need to return the list of all unique quadruplets in an array. The order of the quadruplets and the numbers within a quadruplet do not matter.

### Understanding the Problem:

Note, the problem specifies that the quadruplets must be unique. This implies that the solution must avoid returning duplicate quadruplets, even if there are multiple ways to get the same four numbers that sum up to `target`. The problem description does not mention anything about the array being sorted, so we might need to sort the array ourselves as part of our solution.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

#### Approach 1: Brute Force

The brute force approach to solving this problem would involve checking all possible combinations of quadruplets to see which ones sum up to the `target`. You would generate all possible quadruplets using four nested loops and, for each one, check if it sums to `target`, then track which ones are unique before returning the results. However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n^4), which is highly inefficient and would lead to a timeout for large arrays.

#### Approach 2: Hashing

A slightly more efficient approach would involve using a hash table to find pairs of numbers that sum up to a specific value, reducing the problem to a two-pointer problem within a loop. Although faster than the brute force method, the complexity remains high because of the need to deal with possible duplicates, and it may still lead to timeouts for larger inputs.

#### Approach 3: Sorting with Two Pointers

The most efficient approach would be to first sort the array. Once sorted, you can iterate through the array using four pointers (or indices) in a specific manner to avoid duplicates and to efficiently find quadruplets that sum to the target value. 

Here's how this approach works:

1. Sort the array.
2. Iterate over the array using four indices: i, j, left, and right. `i` and `j` are the first two numbers in the quadruplet, and they are selected using the first two nested loops. `left` and `right` are used for the inner two numbers and they are initially set to `j+1` and `len(nums)-1`, respectively.
3. For each selection of `i` and `j`, you use the two-pointer technique to find pairs that sum up to the remaining target (original target minus the sum of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`). If a valid pair is found, you add it to the result.
4. To avoid duplicates, you need to move the pointers past any duplicate values after finding a valid quadruplet.

#### Python Code Explanation:

The code for this optimal strategy will be broken down and explained in detail shortly.

### Examples:

If `nums = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2]` and `target = 0`, then the function should return `[[-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, -1, 1, 2], [-2, 0, 0, 2]]`, as these are the unique quadruplets which sum up to the target.

### Complexity Analysis:

Sorting the array takes O(n log n). The two outer loops run in O(n^2) time and the two pointers in the innermost part result in O(n) time for each pair of `i` and `j`. Hence, the overall time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^3). The space complexity is O(n) for the sorting if the in-place sort is not considered, or O(1) if the in-place sort is considered, plus the space needed to store the results.

### Real-World Applications:

This kind of problem illustrates algorithms that are relevant in many fields, such as computational finance (e.g., portfolio optimization), data analysis, and more. These problems teach us how to deal with combinations and how to avoid duplicates, which can be translated into many real-world scenarios where we have to find unique combinations or solutions out of a pool of options.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Forgetting to sort the array beforehand, which is key to the two-pointer approach.
- Not properly handling duplicates can lead to incorrect results.
- It's crucial to handle the pointers' movement carefully, especially after finding a valid quadruplet, to skip over duplicates.
- Edge cases such as an input array with fewer than four numbers should be handled explicitly, typically by returning an empty array early.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem belongs to the pattern of ""Two Pointers"" or ""k-Sum Problems"". Recognizing this pattern is essential in efficiently solving problems that require finding elements in an array that add up to a specific total.

### Links to Similar Problems:

Skills learned can be applied in these problems by understanding how to iterate over arrays in nested loops and how to use the two-pointer technique effectively.

Now let's write the code for the optimal approach described."
19,"LeetCode Problem #19 is titled ""Remove Nth Node From End of List"". This is a linked list problem, where the task is to remove the Nth node from the end of a linked list and return the head of the modified list.

Here's the detailed breakdown of the problem:

#### Problem Statement:

Given the head of a linked list, remove the Nth node from the end of the list and return its head. It is guaranteed that N is a valid index, meaning that there are at least N nodes in the linked list.

#### Examples:

Let's consider a few examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`, `n = 2`
   - Output: `[1,2,3,5]`
   - Explanation: The linked list is `1->2->3->4->5`. After removing the second node from the end, which is `4`, the linked list becomes `1->2->3->5`.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `head = [1]`, `n = 1`
   - Output: `[]`
   - Explanation: The linked list is `1`. As there is only one node, removing the one node results in an empty list.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `head = [1,2]`, `n = 1`
   - Output: `[1]`
   - Explanation: The linked list is `1->2`. After removing the last node `2`, the linked list becomes `1`.

#### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is `sz`.
- `1 <= sz <= 30`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `1 <= n <= sz`

#### Problem Analysis:

There are usually two main approaches to solve this problem:

1. **Two-pass approach:**
   In this approach, we first find the length of the linked list, then calculate the position of the node to be deleted from the beginning, and proceed to remove it.

2. **One-pass approach (also called the two-pointer technique):**
   This technique involves placing two pointers separated by n nodes apart and moving them together until the second pointer reaches the end. The first pointer will then be pointing to the node that we need to remove.

The one-pass or two-pointer approach is generally preferred over the two-pass approach due to its efficiency. Since we're working with a linked list, we cannot directly access the Nth node from the end without traversing the list.

#### Solution Rationale:

We'll discuss the one-pass approach for its efficiency and because it is an opportunity to illustrate an interesting technique.

Here's how the one-pass approach works:

1. We introduce two pointers called `first` and `second` and set them both to the head of the linked list.
2. We move the `second` pointer `n` steps forward.
3. We simultaneously move both `first` and `second` pointers one step at a time until `second` is pointing at the last node of the list.
4. Now, `first` is pointing at the node before the one we want to remove. We can then just adjust the `next` pointer of `first` to skip the next node, thereby deleting it from the list.
5. We must also handle the edge case where the node to be removed is the head of the list.

#### Python Code Explanation:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def removeNthFromEnd(head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = head
    first = dummy
    second = dummy
    
    # Move second ahead by n steps
    for i in range(n + 1):
        second = second.next
    
    # Move first to the node preceding the one to delete
    while second:
        first = first.next
        second = second.next
    
    # Remove the nth node from the end
    first.next = first.next.next
    
    # Return the modified list
    return dummy.next
```

Note that we use a dummy node to handle the edge case where we have to delete the head node.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(L), where L is the length of the linked list. Even though we're doing it in one pass, the first pointer will traverse the whole list.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we're only using two extra pointers regardless of the size of the list.

#### Real-World Applications:

This problem is a classic example of manipulating linked lists, a data structure commonly used to represent sequences of elements in a way that allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements at any position.

#### Common Pitfalls:

Forgetting to handle the edge case where the `n`th node from the end is the head node can result in null pointer exceptions. This is why we use a dummy node, which eliminates special handling for the head node.

#### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem follows the ""Runner"" or ""Two-Pointer"" technique, which is useful in many linked list problems that require one pointer to lag behind the other by a certain distance or to detect cycles.

#### Links to Similar Problems:

Several other LeetCode problems involve manipulating linked lists and may utilize two-pointer techniques; for example:
- Problem #141, ""Linked List Cycle""
- Problem #142, ""Linked List Cycle II""
- Problem #876, ""Middle of the Linked List""

Applying the skills learned in this problem to similar challenges involving linked lists and two-pointers can greatly aid in understanding and solving them efficiently."
20,"LeetCode problem number 20 is titled ""Valid Parentheses"". This is a problem in the domain of string parsing and stack usage. Let's dissect the problem, its requirements, and constraints before we talk about potential solutions.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The problem presents the user with a string containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['`, and `']'`. The task is to determine if the input string is valid. A string is considered valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

This problem assesses the user's ability to use data structures to maintain the state and to efficiently navigate through the sequence of characters to validate the string based on the two rules mentioned above.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The natural solution to this problem involves using a stack, which is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Here's why a stack is ideal for this problem:

- **Last In, First Out Principle**: In a series of parentheses, the last open parenthesis must be the first one to be closed. This directly corresponds to the push and pop operations of a stack.
- **Matching Pairs**: Only the top of the stack needs to be checked when encountering a closing bracket to see whether it matches the expected opening bracket.

Here's how the solution would work using a stack:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate through each character in the string.
   - If the character is an opening bracket (`'('`, `'{'`, `'['`), push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket (`')'`, `'}'`, `']'`):
     - Check if the stack is empty. If so, the string is invalid because there's no corresponding opening bracket.
     - Otherwise, pop the top element from the stack and check if it matches the type with the closing bracket.
     - If it does not match, the string is invalid.
3. After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, then all brackets were properly closed and the string is valid. Otherwise, the string is invalid because there are unclosed opening brackets.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's convert the solution described above into Python code:

```python
def isValid(s: str) -> bool:
    bracket_map = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
    open_brackets = set(['(', '{', '['])
    stack = []
    
    for char in s:
        if char in open_brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in bracket_map:
            if not stack or bracket_map[char] != stack.pop():
                return False
        else:
            # If it's not a bracket, it's not valid.
            return False
    
    return not stack  # If stack is empty, it's valid.
```

In this code, `bracket_map` is a dictionary that associates each closing bracket with its corresponding opening bracket. This makes it easy to check for matching pairs. `open_brackets` is a set that contains all the opening brackets, making membership testing efficient.

The `for` loop iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is an opening bracket, it's pushed onto the stack. If the character is a closing bracket, the code checks if the stack is empty or if the top element of the stack does not match the associated opening bracket. If either of these conditions is true, it returns `False`, indicating that the string is invalid. If none of the characters in the string cause it to return `False`, it checks if the stack is empty at the end. An empty stack means that all brackets were matched and closed properly, so it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's consider a few examples to see how `isValid` would operate on different inputs:

1. `""()""`: This string is clearly valid. The opening `(` is closed by the corresponding `)`.
2. `""(]""`: This string is invalid because the `]` does not correctly close `(`.
3. `""([)]""`: Although all types of brackets are present, they are not correctly nested, so the string is invalid.
4. `""{[]}""`: This string is valid since all types of brackets are opened and closed in the correct order.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we iterate through each character in the string exactly once.

The space complexity is also O(n) in the worst-case scenario, which happens when all the characters are opening brackets, and we end up pushing all of them onto the stack.

### Real-World Applications

The problem of validating parentheses is not just an academic exercise. It has real-world applications in scenarios where expressions or blocks of code have to be validated for correctness, such as:

- Compilers and interpreters for programming languages need to check for properly nested parentheses during the syntax analysis phase.
- Text editors and IDEs use similar algorithms to match parentheses, braces, and brackets, providing developers with real-time feedback on syntax errors.
- Evaluating mathematical expressions provided by the user in scientific calculators or mathematical software also requires a check for valid parentheses.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

Common pitfalls in implementing the solution can include:

- Forgetting to handle cases with an odd number of brackets, which can never be valid.
- Returning `True` too early without checking if there are unmatched opening brackets left on the stack.
- Not considering non-bracket characters, which should lead to returning `False` according to the problem constraints.

A useful trick could be to create a direct mapping for closing brackets to their corresponding opening ones. This avoids the use of if-else statements to check the type of bracket and makes the code cleaner and more efficient.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem falls under the category of stack-based parsing problems. Recognizing this pattern is useful in solving similar problems that involve nested structures or sequences that need to be processed in reverse order of their appearance.

21,"LeetCode Problem 21 is titled ""Merge Two Sorted Lists,"" and it is classified under the category of Linked Lists. Here's an extensive breakdown of the problem:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The problem provides you with two sorted linked lists, `list1` and `list2`, and asks you to merge them into a single sorted linked list and return it. The sorting is to be done in non-decreasing order, which means the elements should be sorted in ascending order.

The subtle nuance in this problem involves handling different lengths of linked lists and also dealing with empty linked lists as input. It's important to properly handle these cases to avoid null pointer exceptions or similar errors related to linked list operations.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
To solve this problem, you typically have several strategies to choose from:

1. **Iterative Approach**:
   - Create a dummy node that will act as the starting point for the merged linked list.
   - Keep references to the current nodes in each list (`list1` and `list2`).
   - Compare the values at these current nodes and append the smaller one to the merged linked list.
   - Move the pointer forward in the list from which the node was taken.
   - Continue until all nodes from both lists are exhausted.
   - Return the merged list starting from the dummy node's next pointer (since the dummy node is not part of the actual merged list).

2. **Recursive Approach**:
   - If any of the lists is empty, return the non-empty list.
   - Compare the values at the heads of both lists.
   - The smaller node will be selected as the head for the merged list.
   - Use recursion to merge the rest of the lists and link the lists properly.

We prefer the iterative approach when dealing with linked lists in a language like Python due to the limitations on stack size which can cause a stack overflow error if the lists are too long. The iterative method is generally safer to prevent this kind of issue.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's go with the iterative method for this explanation.

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def mergeTwoLists(list1, list2):
    # Initialize a dummy node that will serve as a placeholder before the sorted list begins.
    dummy = ListNode()
    # `current` will point to the last node in the merged list.
    current = dummy
    
    # We loop as long as both list1 and list2 have elements.
    while list1 and list2:
        if list1.val < list2.val:
            current.next = list1
            list1 = list1.next
        else:
            current.next = list2
            list2 = list2.next
        # Move the `current` pointer forward.
        current = current.next
    
    # At the end of the while loop, at least one of list1 or list2 is exhausted.
    # We simply attach whatever is remaining of the other list to the merged list.
    current.next = list1 or list2
    
    # The `dummy` node was a placeholder. We return the next node,
    # which is the actual start of the sorted merged list.
    return dummy.next
```

In this code, a `ListNode` class is defined to structure each node of the linked list. The `mergeTwoLists` function creates a dummy node to serve as the starting point and iterates through both `list1` and `list2`, choosing the smaller of the two current nodes at each step and linking them to form the merged sorted linked list. Once one list is exhausted, we attach the remaining part of the other list since it is already sorted.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's consider two linked lists:

- `list1`: 1 -> 2 -> 4
- `list2`: 1 -> 3 -> 4

After merging:
- `merged list`: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity is `O(n + m)` where `n` is the number of elements in `list1` and `m` is the number of elements in `list2`. This happens because we are visiting each element of both lists exactly once.

The space complexity is `O(1)` because we are not using any additional data structures; we're simply rearranging the existing nodes.

### Real-World Applications:

The merging of sorted lists is commonly used in algorithms such as Merge Sort for sorting elements, and in various applications such as merging different databases, combining ordered logs, and merging streams of sorted data in real-time processing systems.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

A common pitfall is not handling the end condition properly, which might result in an incomplete merged list or an infinite loop. It's crucial to check whether the current node exists before moving ahead.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem is an example of the ""Two Pointer"" technique widely used in array and linked list problems.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:

Similar problems include:

Each of these problems involves a similar approach to merging but in different scenarios, like merging multiple lists or merging within an array. Understanding how to merge two lists is foundational for tackling more complex problems like these."
22,"LeetCode Problem #22 is ""Generate Parentheses,"" which is a classic problem focused on backtracking. Here's an in-depth analysis of the problem:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem statement asks you to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses for a given number `n`, where `n` is the number of pairs of parentheses.

To clarify, well-formed parentheses mean that each opening parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding closing parenthesis ')', and the pairs must be correctly nested. For example, ""(()())"" is a well-formed combination, but ""(()"" and ""())("" are not.

#### Example:

Input: `n = 3`
Output: `[""((()))"",""(()())"",""(())()"",""()(())"",""()()()""]`

All the outputs consist of exactly 3 pairs of parentheses, and they are all well-formed.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, a backtracking approach is suitable because it allows us to explore all possible states of the problem domain. Backtracking algorithms try to build a solution incrementally, removing those solutions that fail to meet the constraints of the problem at any point in time (hence the name ""backtracking"").

For this specific problem, the constraints are:

1. You can only place a closing parenthesis if there's already an opening parenthesis that hasn't been closed yet.
2. You can start a new pair of parentheses anytime as long as you haven't used up all the `n` pairs.
3. You must use exactly `n` pairs of parentheses.

The idea is to perform a depth-first search (DFS) to build the string of parentheses. At each step, you can either add an opening parenthesis if you still have one (left count < `n`) or add a closing parenthesis if it's legal to do so (right count < left count).

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's dive into the Python code needed to solve this problem using backtracking:

```python
def generateParenthesis(n: int) -> List[str]:
    def backtrack(S='', left=0, right=0):
        if len(S) == 2 * n:
            result.append(S)
            return
        if left < n:
            backtrack(S+'(', left+1, right)
        if right < left:
            backtrack(S+')', left, right+1)

    result = []
    backtrack()
    return result
```

- `generateParenthesis(n):` This is the main function that gets called with `n` pairs of parentheses.

- `backtrack(S='', left=0, right=0):` This is a nested helper function used for backtracking. It takes three parameters:
    - `S` is the current state of the string being built.
    - `left` is the number of left parentheses used so far.
    - `right` is the number of right parentheses used so far.

- `if len(S) == 2 * n:` This checks if the current string `S` has reached the maximum length, which is `2 * n` because each well-formed pair of parentheses is two characters long. If so, the current string `S` is added to the `result` list.

- `if left < n:` This checks if more left parentheses can be added. If possible, the function calls itself recursively with an added left parenthesis.

- `if right < left:` This checks if more right parentheses can be added (we can only add a right parenthesis if the number of right parentheses is less than the number of left parentheses to maintain balance). Again, if possible, the function calls itself recursively with an added right parenthesis.

- `result = []:` This initializes the list that will eventually hold all of the valid combinations.

- `backtrack():` This initiates the recursive backtracking process.

- `return result:` After `backtrack()` has finished executing and all valid combinations have been added to `result`, the list is returned as the final output of the function.

### Elaborate Examples:

Consider `n = 2`. The function calls would look something like this:

1. Start with an empty string `S`.
2. Add a left parenthesis: `S = ""(""`.
3. Can add a left: `S = ""((""`.
4. Cannot add more left without closing, so add a right: `S = ""(()""`.
5. Can add a right to close the open left: `S = ""(())""`.
6. This is a valid combination, so save it. Backtrack.
7. Try another combination: `S = ""()""`.
8. Can add a left since we have only used one pair: `S = ""()(""`.
9. The next valid move is to close it: `S = ""()()""`.
10. This is another valid combination.

The result for `n = 2` would be `[""(())"",""()()""]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: \(O(4^n / \sqrt{n})\). This is the nth Catalan number and is the upper bound for this problem. It accounts for the number of valid parentheses sequences for `n` pairs of parentheses.

Space Complexity: \(O(4^n / \sqrt{n})\) for the output list. The space used by the call stack during the backtracking procedure is \(O(n)\), where `n` is the depth of the recursion tree (which in this case is the length of the string being built).

### Real-World Applications:

Generating all combinations is a common task in fields like combinatorial optimization, game theory, and for generating test cases in software testing.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- One common pitfall is not maintaining the balance between the left and right parentheses, which can lead to generating invalid sequences.
- A useful trick can be to always check the number of used left and right parentheses before adding a new one, which the above code does.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem is a classic example of using backtracking to explore a state space that's constrained by specific rules. Learning to solve it can help with other backtracking problems like permutations, combinations, and other constraint satisfaction problems.

- LeetCode #39 (Combination Sum)

- LeetCode #131 (Palindrome Partitioning)

Each of these problems requires exploring all possibilities to form a solution set, considering constraints specific to the problem scenario. They all can be solved using backtracking by building up potential solutions incrementally and abandoning those that cannot possibly lead to a complete solution."
23,"LeetCode Problem 23 is titled ""Merge k Sorted Lists"" and it is a hard-level problem. Below, I'll provide a detailed analysis of the problem, solution strategies, a breakdown of the Python code, examples, complexity analysis, real-world applications, common pitfalls, problem pattern identification, and links to similar problems.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem statement for ""Merge k Sorted Lists"" is as follows:

You are given an array of `k` linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order. Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

Constraints:
- `k == lists.length`
- `0 <= k <= 10^4`
- `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
- `-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`
- `lists[i]` is sorted in ascending order.
- The sum of `lists[i].length` won't exceed `10^4`.

This problem requires merging multiple sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list. A linked list is a data structure where each element (node) contains a value and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

There are several approaches to tackling this problem:

1. **Brute Force**: Collect all the values from each linked list into an array, sort the array, and then turn it back into a sorted linked list. This is the most straightforward method but not the most efficient.

2. **Compare one by one**: Compare the head of each linked list and choose the node with the smallest value, removing it from its list and adding it to the result list. Repeat this process until all lists are empty.

3. **Divide and Conquer**: Pair up `k` lists and merge each pair, then repeat this process until only one list remains.

4. **Priority Queue**: Use a priority queue (or min heap) to keep track of the head of each non-empty list. Extract the smallest element and add the next element from that list to the queue.

The most efficient method tends to be either the divide and conquer approach or the priority queue method. Both have better than O(nk) time complexity, where n is the total number of nodes.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

We'll use the priority queue approach for the in-depth explanation:

```python
from queue import PriorityQueue

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists):
        head = point = ListNode(0)
        q = PriorityQueue()
        
        for l in lists:
            if l:
                q.put((l.val, l))
                
        while not q.empty():
            val, node = q.get()
            point.next = ListNode(val)
            point = point.next
            node = node.next
            if node:
                q.put((node.val, node))
        
        return head.next
```

- `PriorityQueue` is a built-in Python module that implements a queue data structure with the capability to automatically sort entries as they're entered, so that the smallest entry is always at the front.

- `ListNode` is a class representing a node in a linked list.

- In `mergeKLists`, we initialize a dummy node `head` and a pointer `point` that will be used to build the new sorted linked list.

- We iterate through the initial list of linked lists, adding the first node of each to the priority queue along with its value for comparison.

- While the queue is not empty, we retrieve the smallest node, add a new ListNode with its value to our result list, and advance the pointer.

- If the removed node has a subsequent node (`node.next`), we add that next node to the queue for future comparison.

- Finally, we return `head.next`, which is the head of the merged linked list, excluding the dummy node.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's say we have `k = 3` lists:

```
List 1: 1 -> 4 -> 5
List 2: 1 -> 3 -> 4
List 3: 2 -> 6
```

The priority queue will initially contain the heads of each list (`1, 1, 2`) and their associated nodes. We pop from the queue (`1` from List 1), and the result list starts becoming `1 -> `. We add the next node from List 1 (`4`) to the queue. We repeat this process, each time adding the smallest element to our result list, until the priority queue is empty.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: O(n log k), where n is the total number of nodes and k is the number of linked lists. The `log k` factor comes from the insert and delete operations in the priority queue.
- Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the final merged linked list, plus O(k) for the priority queue, hence O(n + k).

### Real-World Applications:

Merging sorted lists is a common operation in various applications such as:
- Organizing and merging timetables or schedules (such as bus or train schedules) from different sources.
- Combining sorted logs from multiple servers in a time-ordered manner.
- Data synchronization, where multiple datasets need to be merged while maintaining the order.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Don't forget to handle empty lists within the provided array of lists, as they can cause null pointer exceptions.
- It's important to handle the priority queue correctly and make sure to extract elements properly to prevent an infinite loop.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem is a variant of the classic merge sort algorithm. It demonstrates how divide and conquer techniques can efficiently solve problems dealing with multiple sorted structures. Recognizing that this is a merge operation can guide one to consider priority queues or merging techniques as potential solutions.

- Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix (LeetCode 378)
- Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums (LeetCode 373)

Each of these problems involves merging or finding elements in sorted structures, and solutions can be adapted using the techniques discussed for Problem 23."
24,"LeetCode Problem #24 is titled ""Swap Nodes in Pairs"". Below is the problem description followed by a detailed breakdown, solution strategies, example, complexity analysis, and potential real-world applications.

### Problem Description

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

### Example

Input: `head = [1,2,3,4]`
Output: `[2,1,4,3]`

The pairs `(1,2)` and `(3,4)` are swapped to make the linked list `[2,1,4,3]`.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

This problem deals with the manipulation of linked listsâ€”a fundamental data structure where each element (often called a node) contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence. In this scenario, you are required to swap adjacent nodes throughout the entire list.

An adjacent pair consists of two nodes, `n1` and `n2`, where `n2` immediately follows `n1`. After swapping, `n2` comes before `n1`. The reference changes within the list must respect the property that all nodes must remain connected in a single sequence without any breaks or cycles.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

An iterative approach can be used to solve this problem effectively. Here's a step-by-step process:
1. Define a function that accepts the head of the linked list.
2. Create a dummy node that points to the head of the list. This acts as a previous node pointer to help manage the swaps.
3. Initialise a pointer to ""current"" node that starts at the dummy node.
4. Iterate through the list while the current node has at least two more nodes following it.
5. Swap the next two nodes by changing the references. Make sure to keep all the nodes properly connected and update the current pointer to move it two nodes forward each time.
6. Once the end of the list is reached, return the node after the dummy node.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def swapPairs(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = head
    current = dummy

    while current.next and current.next.next:
        first = current.next
        second = current.next.next
        first.next = second.next
        current.next = second
        second.next = first
        current = first

    return dummy.next
```

- `ListNode` class: Represents a singly linked list node with a value and a reference to the next node.
- `swapPairs` function: Contains the logic to manage the node swaps.
- `dummy`: A placeholder node that makes it easier to handle edge cases, particularly when the head of the list is being swapped.
- `current`: A pointer that moves along the list to keep track of where the swapping should occur.
- `first` and `second`: Pointers to the current pair of nodes to be swapped.
- Inside the loop, we perform the swap by rearranging the pointers. We update `first.next` to point to the node after `second`, effectively removing `first` and `second` from their original positions. Then we point `current.next` to `second`, and `second.next` to `first`, thus swapping the nodes.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's consider a list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. Applying the `swapPairs` function would lead to the following steps:
1. Pair `(1, 2)`: Swap to become `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]`.
2. Pair `(3, 4)`: Swap to become `[2, 1, 4, 3, 5]`.
3. There is no pair left for `5`. It remains in its place.
4. Final result is `[2, 1, 4, 3, 5]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the list. This is because we process each node exactly once in a single pass.
- Space Complexity: O(1) as we only use a fixed amount of additional space (a few pointers) regardless of the size of the input list.

### Real-World Applications

Linked list manipulation tasks like the one in this problem occur in many practical applications, such as:
- Data structure modifications for algorithms and data manipulation.
- Memory management systems where objects are often stored in a linked list structure.
- The implementation of certain algorithms that require the shuffling or reordering of elements.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

Common pitfalls include:
- Forgetting to update `current` to move it forward after swapping nodes. This would lead to an infinite loop or skipping nodes.
- Not properly handling the last pair when the list has an odd number of nodes.

Key tricks:
- Utilize a dummy node to simplify the handling of the head of the list.
- Make sure to always consider the existence of the `next` node before proceeding with swaps to avoid `NoneType` errors.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem can be seen as a pattern of in-place transformation of a data structure without the use of additional memory. Recognizing such patterns can help solve similar problems, where manipulation of data structure elements is required while maintaining the structure's integrity.

- Reverse Nodes in k-Group (Problem #25)
- Rotate List (Problem #61)
- Reorder List (Problem #143)

Each of these problems involves directly manipulating the nodes in a linked list, and skills learned in this problem can be applied to them as well."
25,"LeetCode problem number 25 is ""Reverse Nodes in k-Group"". Below is an extensive breakdown and analysis of the problem:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

In this problem, you are given a linked list and an integer k. You are tasked with reversing the nodes of the list k at a time and returning its modified list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k, then the nodes that are left at the end of the linked list should remain as is.

You cannot alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

The problem also stipulates that you should only use constant extra memory (O(1)), and the solution must work within the linked list data structure without converting it to another data type like an array or string.

This problem requires a strong understanding of linked list manipulation and space-efficient algorithms.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, you should consider iterating through the linked list in segments of length k and reversing those segments one by one. The challenge here lies in properly reconnecting the reversed segments with the rest of the list without losing track of the nodes.

Here's a step-by-step strategy to solve the problem:

1. Identify the k nodes to reverse. If there are less than k nodes remaining, leave them untouched.
2. Reverse the identified k nodes.
3. Connect the reversed part to the previously processed part of the list.
4. Proceed to the next k nodes until you reach the end of the list.

To achieve this with O(1) extra space, you must manipulate pointers as you iterate through the linked list.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

The steps can be translated into Python code using a two-pass or sometimes a one-pass algorithm with careful pointer manipulations. Here is a typical solution, which we can discuss in detail afterward:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def reverseKGroup(head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = head
    group_prev = dummy

    while True:
        kth = group_prev
        for _ in range(k):
            kth = kth.next
            if not kth:
                return dummy.next
        
        group_next = kth.next
        prev, curr = kth.next, group_prev.next
        
        for _ in range(k):
            tmp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = tmp
        
        tmp = group_prev.next
        group_prev.next = kth
        group_prev = tmp

    return dummy.next
```

This code involves two primary pointers: `group_prev` and `group_next`. `group_prev` keeps track of the node just before the current group of k nodes to be reversed, and `group_next` is the node just after. A temporary dummy node is used to simplify edge cases, such as when the head of the list is part of a reversed group.

In each iteration of the while loop, we:

1. Identify the kth node by advancing `k` steps through the list. If we reach the end before counting to k, we are done and return the modified list.
2. The next step is to perform the actual reversal of the k nodes using a for loop, with careful reassignment of the `.next` pointers to reverse the sublist.
3. After reversing the group, we need to reconnect the newly reversed sublist back into the main list. This involves setting the `.next` pointer of the node before the group (`group_prev`) to point to the start of the newly reversed sublist.
4. Finally, we prepare for the next iteration by moving the `group_prev` pointer to the end of the newly reversed sublist.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's consider the list `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5` and `k = 2`.

1. We start with a dummy node pointing to 1, and `group_prev` initially also points to the dummy node.
2. We identify the first k=2 nodes, which are 1 and 2, and reverse this pair to get `2 -> 1`.
3. We then reconnect the sublist, now the list looks like `dummy -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`.
4. Move `group_prev` to node 1.

Next, we proceed with the sequence `3 -> 4`, repeat the reversal, and reconnect the sublist.

The end result is `dummy -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5`, and after dropping the dummy node, we get `2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity:
  - For each group of k nodes, we perform O(k) operations to reverse them.
  - Given n total nodes, we have approximately O(n/k) groups.
  - Overall, the time complexity is O(n) since O(k) * O(n/k) = O(n).
  
- Space Complexity:
  - The space complexity is O(1) since we are only using a fixed number of pointers regardless of the size of the list.

### Real-World Applications:

Reversing linked list elements in groups is a common technique in situations where data streams are processed in fixed-length chunks and need reordering before further processing. Examples include network packet processing and applying block ciphers in cryptography.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

When implementing linked list algorithms, it can be easy to inadvertently lose the proper connections between nodes, leading to lost data or infinite loops. To avoid this, use caution when manipulating the `.next` pointers and consider using additional pointers as needed to keep track of critical positions in the list.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem represents a typical linked list manipulation challenge, where mastery of pointer operations is key. Being able to reverse a linked list â€” or parts of it â€” is a common pattern in many linked list problems.

Given a sorted array `nums`, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length. You do not need to consider the elements beyond the new length.

More specifically:

- The input array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- It is necessary to modify the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
- The relative order of the elements should be maintained.
- It's not necessary to remove the extra space created by removed duplicates, just to ensure that the first part of the array contains no duplicates.
- The function should return the new length, which represents the number of unique elements.
- The elements beyond the new length can be left unchanged, as they won't be checked in the test cases.

#### Constraints and Nuances 

- The array can contain integers.
- The length of the array is at most 3 * 10^4.
- The values of integers are within the range [-100, 100].
- The array is guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The typical approach to solve this problem is to use two pointers:

1. **Initialization**: Start with two pointers, `i` and `j`, where `i` is slow-runner and `j` is a fast-runner. Initialize both to 1 (`i = j = 1`) since the first element is never a duplicate.

2. **Traversal**: As long as `j` is less than the length of the array, do the following:
   - If the current element at position `j` is different from the element at `j - 1`, copy the current element to position `i`, and then increment both pointers `i` and `j`.
   - If the current element at position `j` is the same as the element at `j - 1`, just increment `j` while `i` stays in its last position with a unique value.

3. **Return Value**: After the loop terminates, `i` will be at the position where the new length should end, thus return `i`.

This method leverages the fact that the array is sorted, so duplicates are always adjacent.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    i = 0
    for j in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[j] != nums[i]:
            i += 1
            nums[i] = nums[j]
    return i + 1
```

- `if not nums: return 0` checks for an empty array. If the array is empty, the function returns 0 immediately.
- `i = 0` initializes the slow-runner pointer.
- `for j in range(1, len(nums)):` starts the fast-runner at index 1 and iterates through the array.
- `if nums[j] != nums[i]:` checks if the current element is different from the last unique element that `i` points to.
- `i += 1` increments `i` to move to the next unique position.
- `nums[i] = nums[j]` copies the value from `j` to `i`, effectively overwriting duplicates with unique elements.
- `return i + 1` returns the count of unique elements since index `i` is zero-based.

### Elaborate Examples

For example: If the input array is `[1, 1, 2]`, the expected result is `2`, and the array should be modified to `[1, 2, _]`, the underscore `_` indicates we don't care what's beyond the second element. Here's how the algorithm would work:

- `i = 0`, `j = 1`. Since `nums[j] (1)` is equal to `nums[i] (1)`, just increment `j`. Now `i = 0`, `j = 2`.
- `i = 0`, `j = 2`. Since `nums[j] (2)` is not equal to `nums[i] (1)`, increment `i` and set `nums[i]` to `nums[j]`. Now `i = 1`, `nums = [1, 2, 2]`.
- Now that `j` has reached the end, we return `i + 1`, which is `2`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because each element is checked exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), only two variables `i` and `j` are used, and no additional space is required.

### Real-World Applications

An application for this algorithm could be data processing, where duplicate records need to be removed from a sorted list for data analysis or reporting purposes.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Forgetting to handle the empty array edge case separately can lead to index errors.
- Modifying the input array directly rather than returning a separate list is an important aspect. In an interview setting, clarifying in-place modification with the interviewer is crucial.
- Remembering not to use extra space for another array to hold unique values is essential to meet the space complexity requirement.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem is a classical example of the two-pointer technique, where pointers are used to traverse an array efficiently.

- ""Remove Element"" (LeetCode 27)
- ""Remove Linked List Elements"" (LeetCode 203)
- ""Squares of a Sorted Array"" (LeetCode 977)

Each of these problems involves learning how to manipulate arrays or linked lists in various ways using pointers, often employing similar two-pointer strategies."
27,"LeetCode problem number 27 is titled ""Remove Element,"" and the description is as follows:

**Problem Statement**:
Given an array `nums` and a value `val`, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

**Do not allocate extra space for another array**, you must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

**Clarification**:
Confusion often occurs because the problem statement is asking you to modify the array in-place, which means that the size of the input array cannot be physically changed. Instead, you are to return the new length of the array after your modifications, which essentially means that the first part of the array up to that new length should not contain the value `val`.

**Function Signature**:
```python
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
```

**Parameters**:
- `nums` (List[int]): An array of integers, which you can assume to be mutable (i.e., you can modify its contents).
- `val` (int): An integer representing the value to remove from the array.

**Returns**:
- `int`: The new length of the array after removing all occurrences of `val`.

**Example**:
If given `nums = [3,2,2,3]` and `val = 3`, after your function, the array could be `[2,2]` with the new length returned as 2.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
The goal is to remove all instances of `val` while maintaining the relative order of other elements. We can use the two-pointer technique to solve this efficiently.

1. **Two-Pointer Approach**:
   
   Have two pointers, `i` and `j`. The first pointer `i` iterates over the array while the second pointer `j` keeps track of the position to place the next non-`val` element.
   
   For each element at index `i`:
   - If `nums[i]` is not equal to `val`, we copy `nums[i]` to `nums[j]` and increment `j`.
   - If `nums[i]` is equal to `val`, we do nothing and move on (i.e., `i` gets incremented but `j` does not).
   
   The number of non-`val` elements will be `j` after we finish iterating over the array.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Here is the sample code using the two-pointer approach:

```python
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        j = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != val:
                nums[j] = nums[i]
                j += 1
        return j
```

In this code:
- We start with two pointers, `j` and `i`, both initialized to 0.
- We iterate through all elements in the `nums` array with `i`.
- Whenever the current element `nums[i]` does not match `val`, we copy it to `nums[j]` and increment `j`.
- If `nums[i]` matches `val`, `i` increments while `j` does not - effectively skipping over that element.
- After the loop, `j` will be the new length of the array, since it represents the next index to be filled, and hence the number of elements copied.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array. We traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

### Real-World Applications:
This algorithm can be applied in any scenario where in-place modifications need to be done to filter out unwanted elements from a list or array. For example, processing raw data to remove corrupted entries or unwanted noise.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- One common pitfall is to try and physically remove elements from the array, which would create a new array or require shifting elements, thus using extra memory or increasing time complexity.
- A trick in this problem is to use the ""fast-slow pointer"" technique to efficiently solve it in-place.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
The strategy applied here is the ""two-pointer technique,"" often used in problems involving arrays or linked lists where you need to modify or check two separate elements simultaneously.

28,"LeetCode Problem #28 is titled ""Implement strStr()"". This problem is a classical one, often associated with string manipulation and searching algorithms. Here's a detailed breakdown of the problem and how it can be solved in Python.

### Problem Statement

The problem asks you to implement the `strStr()` function, which finds the first occurrence of a substring (needle) in a string (haystack). The function should return the index of the first occurrence of the needle in the haystack, or -1 if the needle is not part of the haystack.

Here is the function signature as defined by LeetCode:

```python
def strStr(haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
```

#### Inputs
- `haystack`: A string where we need to search for the `needle`.
- `needle`: A string that we want to find in the `haystack`.

#### Output
- An integer representing the index where `needle` is first found within `haystack`. If `needle` is not found, return -1. If `needle` is an empty string, return 0, as defined by the convention for this problem.

#### Constraints
- `0 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `haystack` and `needle` consist of only lower-case English characters.

### Solution Rationale

There are several approaches to solve the problem, ranging from naive brute-force methods to sophisticated string-searching algorithms. We'll explore some of these methods.

#### Approach 1: Substring Brute-force

The straightforward approach is to check all possible substrings of `haystack` that are of the same length as `needle`. You'd compare each substring with `needle` and if a match is found, you return the starting index of that substring.

#### Approach 2: Sliding Window

This approach is a slight optimization over the brute-force method. You move a window of size equal to `needle` length across `haystack` and check if the current window matches `needle`. This is done by comparing characters one by one.

#### Approach 3: KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) Algorithm

The KMP algorithm is a more advanced string matching algorithm that avoids unnecessary comparisons. It first preprocesses `needle` to build a longest prefix-suffix array (also known as pi or lps array). This array is used while searching `needle` in `haystack` to skip characters that have already been matched.

#### Approach 4: Using Python's Built-in Functions

In practice, outside of the context of LeetCode's constraint to implement the function, Python's standard library includes the built-in `find()` or `index()` methods that provide this functionality. However, using these directly would defeat the educational purpose of the problem.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's implement Approach 2: Sliding Window since it's relatively simple yet efficient for most cases:

```python
def strStr(haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
    # Edge case: If needle is empty, return 0
    if not needle:
        return 0
    
    # Lengths of haystack and needle
    len_h, len_n = len(haystack), len(needle)
    
    # Slide over the haystack with a window the size of needle
    for i in range(len_h - len_n + 1):
        # Check if the substring matches the needle
        if haystack[i:i+len_n] == needle:
            return i
            
    # Needle not found in haystack
    return -1
```

#### Explanation

1. **Edge Case**: First, if the `needle` is an empty string, we return `0` according to the problem definition.

2. **Length Calculation**: We calculate the lengths of `haystack` and `needle` to avoid repeated computation inside the loop.

3. **Sliding Window**: We loop through `haystack` up to `len_h - len_n + 1`, ensuring we don't go out of bounds when checking the last possible substring of length `len_n`.

4. **Substring Comparison**: Inside the loop, we slice `haystack` from index `i` to `i+len_n` and compare it to `needle`. If they match, we return the index `i`.

5. **Return -1**: If we complete the loop without finding a match, we return `-1`.

### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: The worst-case time complexity is O((n - m + 1) * m), where n is the length of the haystack and m is the length of the needle. This is due to potentially checking all substrings of the haystack against the needle.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) since we are not using any additional space proportional to the input size.

### Examples

Let's demonstrate how the function works with some examples:

1. `haystack = ""hello"", needle = ""ll""` should return `2`.
2. `haystack = ""aaaaa"", needle = ""bba""` should return `-1`.
3. `haystack = """", needle = """"` should return `0`.

### Real-World Applications

The problem of substring search is fundamental in many real-world applications, including text editing, data retrieval, DNA sequence analysis, and network search protocols.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Remember to handle edge cases like empty needle string.
- Make sure your loop doesn't run out of bounds when checking for a substring in the haystack.
- When comparing a substring with the needle, use Python's slice notation to your advantage to write concise and readable code.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem fits into the pattern of string manipulation and searching algorithms, where efficient searching and matching are crucial.

- LeetCode #686 - Repeated String Match (related to string searching)
- LeetCode #459 - Repeated Substring Pattern (involves searching for patterns within a string)

Each of these problems requires understanding how to search for substrings or patterns within larger strings, and techniques like KMP can be applied in several of them."
29,"LeetCode Problem 29 is titled ""Divide Two Integers"". The problem description is as follows:

Given two integers `dividend` and `divisor`, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

Return the quotient after dividing `dividend` by `divisor`.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, `truncate(8.345) = 8` and `truncate(-2.7335) = -2`.

Note:
- Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: `[âˆ’2^31, 2^31 âˆ’ 1]`. For this problem, if the division result overflows, return `2^31 âˆ’ 1`.
- The divisor will never be `0`.

Example 1:
```
Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 10/3 = truncate(3.33333..) = 3.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
Output: -2
Explanation: 7/-3 = truncate(-2.33333..) = -2.
```

In this problem, we must perform an integer division operation while adhering to certain constraints:

1. We cannot use the multiplication, division, or modulus operators.
2. The result should be truncated toward zero.
3. We need to handle possible integer overflow, which can occur when dividend or divisor are near the limits of 32-bit signed integers.

To solve this problem, we could perform ""long division"" or use a bit manipulation technique known as ""bitwise shifting"". Let's explore both methods, but predominantly we will focus on the more efficient bit manipulation strategy.

### Long Division Approach:

One straightforward approach would be to repeatedly subtract the divisor from the dividend until the dividend is less than the divisor, counting the number of subtractions. This method would work, but it is very inefficient for large numbers since it could potentially require many iterations.

### Bitwise Shifting Approach (Preferred):

The more efficient method involves bit manipulation. The key idea is to double (left shift) the divisor until it is just less than the dividend and then subtract that value from the dividend. By doing this iteratively and keeping track of the number of shifts, we can obtain the quotient without direct division.

Bitwise shifting works because when we left shift a number by one, it's equivalent to multiplying the number by 2. This operation is allowed by the problem constraints.

Let's break down the steps involved in this approach:

1. **Handle Edge Cases**: Start by considering the edge cases, such as the divisor being 1 or -1, or the dividend being 0.
2. **Sign Calculation**: Determine the sign of the result based on the signs of the dividend and divisor.
3. **Absolute Values**: Work with the absolute values of the dividend and divisor to simplify the calculations.
4. **Doubling the Divisor**: Shift the divisor to the left until it is just smaller than the dividend.
5. **Subtract and Record**: Subtract the shifted divisor from the dividend, and record the number of shifts as part of the quotient.
6. **Reiterate**: Update the dividend to the remainder of the subtraction and repeat the process until the dividend is smaller than the original divisor.
7. **Assemble Final Result**: Apply the sign to the accumulated shifts to get the final quotient.
8. **Handle Overflow**: If the calculated quotient is beyond the 32-bit signed integer range, return the maximum integer value `2^31 - 1`.

Now, let's implement this approach in Python code and further explain each line:

```python
class Solution:
    def divide(self, dividend: int, divisor: int) -> int:
        # Edge cases: when divisor is 1, -1, or dividend is 0
        if divisor == -1 and dividend == -2**31:
            return 2**31 - 1  # Handle overflow case
        if divisor == 1:
            return dividend
        if dividend == 0:
            return 0

        # Determine sign of the result (True if signs are different)
        negative = (dividend < 0) != (divisor < 0)

        # Work with absolute values to simplify multiplication and division
        dividend, divisor = abs(dividend), abs(divisor)

        quotient = 0
        # The main loop where bit manipulation happens
        while dividend >= divisor:
            temp, multiple = divisor, 1
            while dividend >= (temp << 1):
                temp <<= 1
                multiple <<= 1
            # Subtract the largest doubled divisor and add the multiples
            dividend -= temp
            quotient += multiple

        # Apply the sign to the result
        quotient = -quotient if negative else quotient

        # Clamp the result to the 32-bit signed integer range
        return min(max(-2**31, quotient), 2**31 - 1)
```

In the code above, we take care of edge cases first, such as overflow and divisor being 1 or -1. We then work with absolute values, keeping track of the sign separately. We initiate a while loop, where we execute the bit manipulation strategy, doubling `temp` until it's just below the `dividend`. After that, we subtract this value from `dividend` and add the discovered `multiple` to the `quotient`. This is repeated until `dividend` is less than `divisor`. Finally, we assign the sign and ensure that the final result is within the 32-bit signed integer range.

### Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of the bitwise shifting approach is O(log^2 N), where N is the dividend. This is because, in the worst-case scenario, we double the divisor logN times (in each outer loop iteration) and perform logN comparisons in the inner loop. It's crucial to note that although the time complexity is logarithmic, we do have two nested loops, which contributes to the squared term. The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1), as we use only a constant amount of extra space for variables.

### Real-World Applications:

Integer division without multiply, divide, and mod operations could be used in systems where such operations are expensive or not available, for instance, in some embedded systems or environments with limited computational capabilities. Also, understanding the manipulation of binary representations of numbers is crucial in areas like cryptography, computer graphics, and low-level hardware programming.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

A common pitfall to watch out for is not properly handling the sign of the inputs and the edge case where the result might overflow. Additionally, it's easy to miss that left-shifting can quickly lead to values that exceed integer bounds, so one must be careful to check that we don't exceed the dividend before performing the shift operation.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem has a pattern of bitwise manipulation and simulating operations not directly allowed by the constraints. Recognizing this problem-solving pattern can be useful in similar constraints-based problems or optimization tasks where standard operations are costly or restricted.

### Similar LeetCode Problems:

30,"LeetCode Problem 30 is referred to as ""Substring with Concatenation of All Words"". This is a hard-level problem that demands a thorough understanding of string manipulation, hashing, and sliding window techniques in algorithms. Let's break down the problem in detail.

## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words` of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in `s` that is a concatenation of each word in `words` exactly once and without any intervening characters.

**Input:** 
The input consists of a string `s` and an array of strings `words`.

**Output:** 
The output should be a list of starting indices of the substring(s) in `s` that fulfill the criteria mentioned in the problem statement.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
- All the strings consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, you need to perform the following steps:

1. **Hashing each word in `words`:**
   Create a hash table (like a dictionary in Python) to store the count of each word in the `words` list. This hash table would help to quickly check if a word is part of `words`.

2. **Traversing the string `s`:**
   Traverse `s` with a sliding window that would attempt to match the concatenation of words from `words`. The window size must be equal to the sum of all the lengths of the words in `words`.

3. **Matching the words in the sliding window:**
   Within each window, divide the window into segments equal to the length of the words in `words`. For each segment, check if the segment exists in the hash table, and decrease its count, noting that counts shouldn't fall below zero (which would imply more occurrences than needed). If all words match correctly, record the starting index of the window.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   Ensure that you should cover edge cases where `s` is shorter than the sum of the lengths of `words`, or where `words` is empty.

5. **Resetting Window Counts:**
   After traversing a window, if the entire concatenation isn't found, reset the relevant counts in the hash table and slide the window forward.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation

Upon coding this solution, the explanation will be provided line by line.

## Elaborate Examples

For instance, if `s` is `""barfoothefoobarman""` and `words` is `[""foo"",""bar""]`, then `s[0:6]` (""barfoo"") and `s[9:15]` (""foobar"") are the substrings starting at indices `0` and `9` that contain a concatenation of ""foo"" and ""bar"".

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * m * len)` where `n` is the length of the string `s`, `m` is the number of words, and `len` is the average length of a word in `words`. This is because we are traversing the string and within each traversal, iterating over the words.
  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m)` where `m` is the number of words as we create a hash map to maintain the count of words.

## Real-World Applications

This problem can be correlated to situations where we need to match patterns in a given text, such as detecting plagiarism, search engines matching queries with documents, or DNA sequence alignment in bioinformatics.

## Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- **Pitfall**: Not accounting for overlapping words when sliding the window.
- **Trick**: Using a double hash table (current count and expected count) to avoid recomputation.

## Problem Pattern Identification

This problem is a classic example of the ""Sliding Window"" pattern, often used when you have an array/string and you're looking for some subrange in the array/string, such as a substring with some property or the smallest subarray covering all the elements of a set.

31,"LeetCode Problem 31 is ""Next Permutation,"" which is categorized under the array and two pointers topics. This problem requires a good understanding of permutations and algorithms to efficiently find the next lexicographically greater permutation of numbers.

Here's an extensive breakdown of the problem:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

Given an array of integers representing a permutation, the goal is to rearrange the numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

If such an arrangement is not possible (i.e., the array is sorted in descending order), the function should rearrange the numbers into the lowest possible order (ascending order). The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

To better understand the problem, let's take ""permutation"" and ""lexicographic order"" into consideration:

- A **permutation** of an array is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.
- The **lexicographic or lexicographical order** is essentially the dictionary order. For example, in the dictionary, ""apple"" comes before ""banana"". Similarly, for arrays, [1, 2, 3] comes before [1, 3, 2].

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem efficiently, we use the following strategy:

1. Start from the end of the array and look backwards for the first pair of successive elements `(a[i], a[i+1])` where `a[i] < a[i+1]`. This step is crucial because the elements from `i+1` to the end of the array are in descending order and thus, there's no greater permutation possible within that sub-array. The number at `a[i]` is the number that needs to be swapped to make the permutation ""bigger"".

2. Then look backwards again from the end of the array to find the first element that is larger than `a[i]`. Let's call this number `a[j]`.

3. Swap `a[i]` and `a[j]`.

4. Reverse the sub-array that starts at `i+1` to the end of the array to get it in the lowest possible order (ascending order).

This strategy guarantees that we get the next permutation that is just greater than the current one.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's provide the Python code that implements the strategy and then break it down:

```python
def nextPermutation(nums):
    i = j = len(nums) - 1

    # Find first decreasing element
    while i > 0 and nums[i - 1] >= nums[i]:
        i -= 1
    if i == 0:   # nums are in descending order
        nums.reverse()
        return

    # Find successor to pivot
    k = i - 1    # pivot is at index i-1
    while nums[j] <= nums[k]:
        j -= 1
    nums[k], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[k]

    # Reverse suffix starting at i
    l, r = i, len(nums) - 1
    while l < r:
        nums[l], nums[r] = nums[r], nums[l]
        l, r = l + 1, r - 1

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3]
nextPermutation(nums)
print(nums)  # Output: [1, 3, 2]
```

Breaking down the code:
- `i` and `j` are initialized to point to the end of the list.
- The first `while` loop looks for the first decreasing element starting from the end of the `nums`.
- If such an element is not found, which means `i` reaches `0`, then the array is sorted in descending order, and we simply reverse it to get the smallest permutation.
- Next, we find the number just larger than the pivot (`nums[k]`), which is `nums[j]`. We then swap `nums[k]` and `nums[j]`.
- Finally, we reverse the sub-array starting from `i` to turn it into ascending order, which makes it the next smallest sequence of numbers after the original configuration.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's consider a example:
```
Array: 1 2 7 4 3 1
Step 1: Identify the longest non-increasing suffix
Suffix: 7 4 3 1 (wrong direction, it should be non-decreasing from right to left)
Pivot: 2

Step 2: Look for the number just larger than the pivot in the suffix
Number: 3

Step 3: Swap the pivot with the number found
Array after swap: 1 3 7 4 2 1

Step 4: Reverse the suffix
Final array: 1 3 1 2 4 7 (which is the next permutation)
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because each part of the algorithm (finding the first decreasing element, finding the element to swap with, and reversing the suffix) consists of at most one pass through the array.

The space complexity is O(1) since the solution is in place and only a constant amount of extra space is used, regardless of the input size.

### Real-World Applications

The concept of generating permutation sequences can be applied to real-world problems like generating password possibilities, arrangements of different items, scheduling, and in fields such as cryptography, game theory, and others where the ordering of elements is essential.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- One common pitfall is to attempt to generate all permutations and find the next one, which is not efficient.
- A subtle trick is to realize that the sequence is built from the end for optimal efficiency.
- Another common mistake is not realizing that the sequence should be reversed at the end if no ""bigger"" permutation is possible.

### Problem Pattern Identification

32,"LeetCode Problem number 32 corresponds to the ""Longest Valid Parentheses"" problem. Let's dive deep into the various aspects of this problem.

### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring. A valid parentheses string is defined as follows:

- The empty string """" is valid.
- If string ""A"" is valid, then ""A"" surrounded by a pair of parentheses ""()"" is also valid.
- If strings ""A"" and ""B"" are valid, then the concatenation ""AB"" is also valid.

Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', we need to find the length of the longest substring which is a correctly matched parentheses string.

For example:
- Input: ""(()""
- Output: 2
- Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is ""()"".

### Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the indices of the parentheses and their pairing. There are multiple approaches to this problem, ranging from using stacks, dynamic programming, to two-pass algorithms.

#### Using Stack
One of the most common approaches for parentheses problems is to use a stack. The stack can help us keep track of the unmatched parentheses so far. Here is a step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize a stack and push `-1` onto it, which acts as a base for the next valid substring.
2. Iterate through the string. For each character:
   - If itâ€™s `'('`, push the index onto the stack.
   - If itâ€™s `')'`:
     - Pop the top element from the stack. At this point, two scenarios arise:
       - If the stack becomes empty, this means that we've completed a valid set of parentheses, so push the current index onto the stack. This new index will serve as the base for the next valid substring.
       - If the stack is not empty, then the current index minus the new top element of the stack will give us the length of the current valid substring. Update the maximum length accordingly.
3. The maximum length obtained during the iteration is the answer.

#### Dynamic Programming
Another method is to use dynamic programming, where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest valid parentheses ending at index `i`. The recurrence relation can be a bit tricky because the extension of a valid parentheses string might depend on the length computed for the preceding indices.

#### Two-Pass Algorithm
This method avoids using extra space (apart from a few variables to keep count). Traverse the string twice: 
1. First pass (left to right): Each time we encounter '(', we increment a counter, and each time we see ')', we decrement the counter. When the counter is zero, we calculate the length of the valid parentheses so far. If the counter goes negative, we reset the count and start over, because the parentheses are unmatched.
2. Second pass (right to left): This ensures we also cover the cases of unmatched ')' characters by keeping track in the reverse order.

### Complexity Analysis

Letâ€™s analyze the time and space complexity for the stack-based solution.

- **Time Complexity**: *O(n)* -- We traverse the string once, with constant time operations for each character.
- **Space Complexity**: *O(n)* -- In the worst case, the stack can grow up to the size of the input string, for instance in the case of ""((((((("".

The dynamic programming approach also has O(n) time complexity, but it uses O(n) space for the dp array. The two-pass algorithm results in O(n) time complexity, with O(1) space complexity, as it only uses counters.

### Practical Applications

The problem of finding the longest valid parentheses can be a sub-problem in text editors or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) where matching parentheses is essential for code readability and error checking. It also has applications in compilers where syntax parsing involves checking for well-formed expressions.

### Common Pitfalls and Tips

One common pitfall is not considering the base case for the stack where it may become empty, which could cause an error when trying to access the top element. To ensure this doesn't occur, we push `-1` onto the stack before iterating.

Another tip is to be careful with the indices during the stack operations. Sometimes it might be tricky to figure out how to calculate the length of the current valid substring, which is why itâ€™s important to remember that upon finding a matched pair, the length of the valid parentheses is `currentIndex - stackTopIndex`.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem falls under the category of ""Stack"" and ""Dynamic Programming"" problems and demonstrates a pattern where we are trying to find the longest well-formed segment of elements, which is a type of subsequence identification pattern. Recognizing these patterns helps in applying similar methods to other problems like balancing symbols, evaluating reverse Polish notation, or finding the largest rectangle in a histogram.

### Related LeetCode Problems

Similar LeetCode problems explore the use of stacks or dynamic programming and include:

- 20. Valid Parentheses
- 84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram
- 85. Maximal Rectangle
- 1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses
- 1019. Next Greater Node In Linked List

Each of these problems involves similar concepts of using stacks to keep track of certain elements and their positions, or dynamic programming to find optimal sub-structures within a given problem space. Applying the skills learned in identifying the longest valid parentheses can be directly transferred to tackling these related problems.

Now, if we wanted to write code for this problem, it would be best to pick the method that provides a good balance between time and space complexity, and the ease of implementation. The stack-based approach is generally a go-to for many due to its straightforward logic and good performance, even though it doesn't have the best possible space complexity. Would you like to see an implementation of this approach?"
33,"LeetCode problem number 33 is titled ""Search in Rotated Sorted Array"". Let's discuss the problem in depth.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

You are given an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with distinct values), and an integer `target`. Suppose that `nums` is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand (i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`). You must write a function that takes these inputs and returns the index of `target` in `nums`, or `-1` if `target` is not present.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, you should notice that although the array is rotated, one half of the array remains sorted after rotation. You can use this property to determine whether the target is in the sorted half and perform a binary search accordingly.

Here's a step-by-step strategy for a solution using binary search:

1. **Find the middle element**: Calculate the middle index and check if the middle element is the target.
2. **Identify the sorted half**: Determine whether the left or right half of the array is sorted.
3. **Check target in the sorted half**: Check if the target lies within the sorted half.
4. **Modify search range**: If the target is in the sorted half, continue the binary search in that half. If not, the target must be in the other half. Adjust the search range accordingly.
5. **Repeat**: Continue this process until the target is found or the search range is exhausted.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Below is a Python function that implements the aforementioned algorithm.

```python
def search(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # Avoid overflow
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        
        # Check if the left half is sorted
        if nums[left] <= nums[mid]:
            # If target is within the left half range
            if nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        # Right half is sorted
        else:
            # If the target is within the right half range
            if nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
    
    return -1
```

### Elaborate Examples

Suppose `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` and `target = 6`.

1. Initially, `left = 0`, `right = 6`, `mid = 3`.
2. `nums[mid] = 7`, which is not the target. The left half `[4,5,6]` is sorted.
3. Target `6` is in the sorted range `[4,5,6]`. Update `right` to `mid - 1`.
4. Now, `left = 0`, `right = 2`, `mid = 1`.
5. `nums[mid] = 5`, still not the target. The left half `[4,5]` is sorted.
6. Target `6` is not in this range. Update `left` to `mid + 1`.
7. Finally, `left = right = 2`, `mid = 2`.
8. `nums[mid] = 6`, which is the target. Return `mid`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: The binary search halves the search space at each step, so the time complexity is O(log n), where `n` is the length of the input array.

Space complexity: Because the solution uses only a few integer variables and operates within the input array, the space complexity is O(1), indicating constant space usage.

### Real-World Applications

This problem can be analogous to many real-world scenarios where one needs to search for an item efficiently within a partially ordered dataset, such as searching through rotated logs, clock times, or any cyclically sorted dataset.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

Common pitfalls involve not correctly identifying the sorted half of the array and making incorrect assumptions about where the target might be when it lies within the range of the sorted half. Remember that the array is distinct and sorted before rotation which simplifies the conditions.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The problem demonstrates a variant of binary search where instead of a fully sorted array, you have one that possesses sorted halves due to a prior rotation.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems

Related problems typically involve variations of binary search or sorted arrays with modifications like:
- Finding the rotation index (i.e., where the sorted array was cut).
- Searching in a sorted array that might have duplicates (LeetCode problem #81 ""Search in Rotated Sorted Array II"").
- Modifying binary search to work in different scenarios, such as searching in a bitonic array.

Recognizing the pattern of binary search and its adaptability to various constraints is tremendously useful in solving an array of algorithm problems that require efficient searching in potentially modified sorted data."
34,"The LeetCode problem number 34 is titled ""Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array"". This is categorized under the 'Array' and 'Binary Search' topics. Let's delve into an exhaustive analysis of the problem, solution strategies, and explore the intricacies of the task at hand.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The problem statement can be summarized as follows:

- You are given an array of integers `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, and an integer `target`.
- Your task is to find the starting and ending position of a given `target` value in the array.
- If the target is not found in the array, you should return `[-1, -1]`.
- You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

Some nuances of the problem that must be considered:

1. Since the array is sorted, binary search is a natural choice to achieve the required `O(log n)` runtime complexity.
2. You need to identify not just one instance of the target, but the range of indices where the target appears.
3. Handling cases where the target value occurs at the edges of the array or multiple times within it.
4. The need to differentiate between finding no occurrence of the target and finding it at either the first, last, or somewhere in the middle of the array.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The intuition behind the solution is to perform binary search twice, with slight modifications each time. The first binary search identifies the first index where the target occurs, while the second search identifies the last index. Here's a more detailed strategy:

1. **First Occurrence**: To find the left boundary (first occurrence), we modify the binary search such that when we discover an instance of the target value, we continue searching to the left half to ensure there is no other instance of the target before the one found.

2. **Last Occurrence**: Similarly, to find the right boundary (last occurrence), we conduct a binary search where if the target is found, we search the right half of the array to confirm there is no other instance of the target after the one found.

We take advantage of the sorted property for these searches, ensuring that all occurrences of the target are contiguous.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Here, I'll propose a Python function that implements the strategy described above:

```python
def searchRange(nums, target):
    def findLeft(nums, target):
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            elif nums[mid] > target:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                if mid == 0 or nums[mid - 1] != target:
                    return mid
                right = mid - 1
        return -1

    def findRight(nums, target):
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            elif nums[mid] > target:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                if mid == len(nums) - 1 or nums[mid + 1] != target:
                    return mid
                left = mid + 1
        return -1

    return [findLeft(nums, target), findRight(nums, target)]
```

- `searchRange` is the main function that returns a list containing the first and last positions of the target.
- `findLeft` is a helper function optimized to find the left boundary of the target's position.
- `findRight` is a helper function optimized to find the right boundary of the target's position.
- In both helper functions, we maintain pointers `left` and `right` to perform the binary search. Throughout the binary search, `mid` represents the middle point between `left` and `right`.
- If `nums[mid]` is not equal to the target, we adjust the pointers in the typical binary search fashion, moving either `left` or `right`.
- If `nums[mid]` is equal to the target, for `findLeft`, we check if it is the first occurrence by comparing it with the previous element (or if it is the first element of the array). For `findRight`, we do a similar check, comparing it with the next element (or if it is the last element).
- If a boundary is not found, we return `-1`. Otherwise, we return the index of the boundary.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's demonstrate this function with a few examples:

- **Example 1**: `nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10]`, `target = 8`

For this example, `findLeft` would return `3` since `8` first appears at index `3`, and `findRight` would return `4` since that is the last occurrence of `8`. The function, therefore, returns `[3, 4]`.

- **Example 2**: `nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10]`, `target = 6`

Here, since `6` does not occur in the array, both `findLeft` and `findRight` would return `-1`, leading to `[-1, -1]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: The time complexity is `O(log n)` for both searches since each helper function performs a single binary search that has a logarithmic complexity with respect to the input size.
- Space complexity: The space complexity is `O(1)` since we only use a constant amount of extra space for variables.

### Real-World Applications

This kind of search algorithm has real-world applications wherever we have a sorted dataset, and we need to find the range of similar items quickly. For instance:

- In databases, when querying for a range of records with a specific property.
- In UI components like sliders where we need to select a range of values.
- In genomic ranges where we need to find stretches of DNA sequences.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

Common pitfalls include:

- Not considering edge cases such as the target being at the beginning or end of the array.
- Overlooking the case where the array does not contain the target.

Some tricks in implementing binary search for range finding include checking the element next to the mid-pointer to determine if we need to continue searching left or right.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The underlying pattern in this problem is the modification of binary search to perform range queries. Recognizing patterns that involve a binary search can help tackle similar problems that require searching in a sorted dataset.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems

35,"LeetCode problem number 35 is titled ""Search Insert Position."" Let's break down the requirements and nuances of the problem before discussing the solution strategies.

### Problem Statement:

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, you need to find the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You can assume there are no duplicates in the array.

#### Inputs:
1. `nums`: An array of sorted integers.
2. `target`: An integer value to search for in the array.

#### Output:
An integer value representing the index of the target in `nums` if `target` is in the list. Otherwise, return the index where it would be inserted.

#### Examples:

- Example 1:
  - Input: `nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5`
  - Output: `2` (because `5` is present in the array at index `2`).

- Example 2:
  - Input: `nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2`
  - Output: `1` (because `2` is not present in the array and it should be inserted at index `1` which is between `1` and `3`).

- Example 3:
  - Input: `nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7`
  - Output: `4` (because `7` is not present in the array and it should be inserted at the end of the array which is at index `4`).

### Solution Strategies:

A linear search could work but would yield a less efficient solution with a worse time complexity of O(n). However, by exploiting the sorted nature of the array, we can use binary search to achieve a more efficient solution.

#### Binary Search Algorithm:

The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The initial interval includes the whole array. If the value of the target is less than the middle element, we search for the target in the left half of the array. If the value of the target is greater than the middle element, we search in the right half of the array.

This process continues until we find the target or until the interval is empty, meaning the target is not in the array and we would need to return the index where it should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

#### Python Code for Binary Search:

```python
def searchInsert(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return left
```

In this code snippet, `left` and `right` are pointers to the current interval being searched. `mid` calculates the midpoint. If `nums[mid]` is equal to the `target`, we return the `mid` index. If `nums[mid]` is less than the `target`, it implies that the target must be in the right half of the current interval, and we adjust `left`. Conversely, if `nums[mid]` is greater than the `target`, we adjust `right`. If the target is not found, `left` will point to the position where the target should be inserted to maintain order.

### Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because we are using binary search, which cuts the search space in half with each step.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as we are only using a constant amount of extra space.

### Real-World Applications:

This problem is an abstraction of many real-world scenarios where insertion order matters:
- Inserting a new score in a leaderboard that is sorted by score.
- Adding a new event in a timeline sorted by dates.
- Placing a new book on a bookshelf where books are sorted by author or title.

### Common Pitfalls:

- Not handling the case where the element is not found within the array, which should return the insert position.
- Off-by-one errors in adjusting `left` and `right` pointers.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem follows a classical binary search pattern, which is widely applicable in problems dealing with ordered datasets and searching for specific values.

### Related LeetCode Problems:

Problems related to binary search or dealing with ordered arrays are quite common. Some of them include:
- Problem 34: Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
- Problem 278: First Bad Version
- Problem 704: Binary Search

Each of these problems applies the concept of binary search, varying slightly in their conditions and what needs to be returned as the outcome.

The skills learned in this problem, specifically implementing a binary search and understanding its mechanics, are crucial and widely applicable to many algorithmic challenges that deal with sorted data."
36,"LeetCode problem number 36 is titled ""Valid Sudoku,"" and it is classified under the Hash Table and Matrix categories. This problem tests the candidate's understanding of board games and specifically, their ability to validate the classic game ""Sudoku"" according to its rules using data structures like hash tables.

Here's an extensive breakdown of the problem:

## Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem presents a 9x9 grid representing a Sudoku board, initially partially filled with digits from '1' to '9' and empty cells represented by dots ('.'). The task is to determine if the current board configuration is valid.

Sudoku is a number puzzle game with specific rules:
1. Each row of the 9x9 board must contain the digits '1' to '9' without repetition.
2. Each column of the board must also contain the digits '1' to '9' without repetition.
3. The board is divided into nine 3x3 sub-boxes, and each sub-box must also contain the digits '1' to '9' without repetition.

The board is valid if it satisfies these conditions at the same time. If a digit is repeated in a row, column, or 3x3 sub-box, the board is invalid. Empty cells are ignored for the purpose of validation.

One subtle nuance is that the problem doesn't ask to solve the Sudoku but just to validate the given board based on the current placements of the digits.

## In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, a straightforward approach involves three steps that directly map to the Sudoku rules:

1. **Check Each Row**: Iterate through each row and ensure no number is repeated.
2. **Check Each Column**: Iterate through each column and ensure no number is repeated.
3. **Check Each Sub-box**: Iterate through each sub-box and ensure no number is repeated.

A common way to implement each of these checks is by using a hash table (or a set in Python) to keep track of the numbers seen so far. Whenever you encounter a digit, you check if it already exists in the set corresponding to its row, column, or sub-box. If it does, the board is invalid.

Python-specific features or functions that can be useful include:
- `set()` for creating an empty set.
- `add()` for adding an element to a set.
- `in` for checking membership in a set.

An optimization might involve checking all three conditions within a single pass through the board.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Below is a Python code snippet that handles the described approach.

```python
def isValidSudoku(board):
    rows = [set() for _ in range(9)]
    cols = [set() for _ in range(9)]
    boxes = [set() for _ in range(9)]
    
    for i in range(9):
        for j in range(9):
            if board[i][j] != '.':
                num = board[i][j]
                box_index = (i // 3) * 3 + j // 3
                if (num in rows[i] or 
                    num in cols[j] or 
                    num in boxes[box_index]):
                    return False
                rows[i].add(num)
                cols[j].add(num)
                boxes[box_index].add(num)
    return True
```

In this code, we initialize three lists of sets, `rows`, `cols`, and `boxes`, each of size 9, to track the digits we have seen in each respective collection. As we iterate over each cell in the board, we calculate the `box_index` to identify which of the nine 3x3 boxes the current number belongs to. If the current cell contains a digit, we check if it is already in the corresponding row, column, or box set. If so, we return `False`. If not, we add the digit to the corresponding row, column, and box set.

## Elaborate Examples:

Consider the following board where 'E' represents an empty cell shown by dots in the original problem:

```
5 3 E | E 7 E | E E E
6 E E | 1 9 5 | E E E
E 9 8 | E E E | E 6 E
------+------+------
8 E E | E 6 E | E E 3
4 E E | 8 E 3 | E E 1
7 E E | E 2 E | E E 6
------+------+------
E 6 E | E E E | 2 8 E
E E E | 4 1 9 | E E 5
E E E | E 8 E | E 7 9
```

Our function would iterate over each cell, check against the sets, and find no repetition of digits in rows, columns, or sub-boxes. So, it will return `True`.

## Thorough Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of the function is O(1), as the board size is fixed at 9x9, resulting in a constant number of operations. The space complexity is also O(1) for the same reason, despite the extra space used for sets, as the number of sets is fixed to three lists each containing nine sets.

## Real-World Applications:

Validating a Sudoku puzzle is directly applicable to games and puzzles, where it is essential to ensure the player is making legal moves. It could also be part of a bigger system in online gaming platforms, puzzle solvers, or educational tools that teach logic and problem-solving.

## Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

A common mistake might be forgetting to ignore the empty cells. Another pitfall is an incorrect calculation of the `box_index`, leading to checking the wrong sub-box for repetition.

## Problem Pattern Identification:

The pattern here involves validating data against a set of constraints, which applies to numerous problems where you need to ensure no duplicates occur in certain conditions. It closely resembles the principle of maintaining invariants, which is a critical concept in software design.

37,"LeetCode problem number 37 is titled ""Sudoku Solver."" Below you will find a comprehensive analysis of this problem and how to solve it using Python.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

""Sudoku Solver"" is a problem that asks you to write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle. The Sudoku board (partially filled) is represented as a two-dimensional 9x9 grid, and you are required to fill the blank cells with digits in such a way that every row, column, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.

The Sudoku solver must fulfill these conditions:

1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
4. A Sudoku puzzle board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character '.' (period).

It's important to note that there will be only one unique solution for the given Sudoku puzzle, and your function must fill the empty cells with the digits that complete the puzzle.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The classic way to solve a Sudoku puzzle by hand involves looking for cells that can only possibly contain one number and filling those in first. This approach is often not sufficient for harder puzzles, where you need to make guesses and backtrack if they lead to a contradiction.

For programming a Sudoku solver, backtracking is a common technique because it is an efficient way to explore the entire solution space. You try to fill the board one cell at a time, moving forward when the current choice is valid, and backtracking when you reach an invalid state.

Here's the general algorithm for a backtracking approach:

1. Find an empty cell.
2. Try all numbers (1-9) in this cell.
3. For each number, check if it's a valid move by ensuring it doesn't appear in the same row, column, or subgrid.
4. If the move is valid, place the number and move to the next cell (go to step 1).
5. If the move leads to an invalid board (no numbers are valid for the next empty cell), backtrack: erase the last number and try a new one.
6. Repeat this process until you fill all cells, which means the puzzle is solved, or you cannot find a valid number for an empty cell, which means you should backtrack further.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Here's the Python code for a Sudoku solver using the backtracking algorithm:

```python
def solveSudoku(board):
    def isValid(x, y, num):
        for i in range(9):
            if board[x][i] == num: return False  # Check row.
            if board[i][y] == num: return False  # Check column.
            # Check subgrid.
            if board[3 * (x//3) + i//3][3 * (y//3) + i%3] == num: return False
        return True
    
    def solve():
        for i in range(9):
            for j in range(9):
                if board[i][j] == '.':
                    for num in map(str, range(1, 10)):
                        if isValid(i, j, num):
                            board[i][j] = num
                            if solve():
                                return True
                            board[i][j] = '.'  # Backtrack.
                    return False
        return True
    
    solve()
```

Let's break down the Python code step by step:

- `solveSudoku(board)` is the main function that's called to solve the Sudoku puzzle.

- `isValid(x, y, num)` is a helper function that takes a row index `x`, a column index `y`, and a number `num` to check if placing `num` at position `(x, y)` is valid according to Sudoku rules. It does this by checking if `num` already exists in the same row, column, or subgrid.

- The nested loops in `solve()` iterate over every cell in the board.

- If an empty cell (`board[i][j] == '.'`) is found, the algorithm tries every possible number from `1` to `9` (`map(str, range(1, 10))`).

- If a valid number is found (`isValid(i, j, num)`), it is placed on the board (`board[i][j] = num`), and `solve()` is called recursively to attempt to solve the rest of the board.

- If the recursive call to `solve()` returns `True`, it means the board has been successfully solved, and `True` is returned.

- If none of the numbers work (`solve()` returns `False`), a number that was previously placed on the board was incorrect. So, the algorithm performs a backtrack by resetting the last placed number to `.` and returning `False`.

- This backtracking continues until either the board is fully solved or no other valid moves are possible.

- Finally, calling `solve()` starts the solving process.

### Elaborate Examples

Before running this solver on an actual Sudoku board, it's important to analyze how it behaves step by step with a specific example. However, due to the nature of backtracking and the number of permutations, it might not be feasible to go through the entire example here manually, because that would require going through hundreds or thousands of recursive calls, with many instances of backtracking.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this backtracking solution is difficult to determine because it depends on the number of empty cells and the distribution of the given numbers. However, in the worst case, the solver might have to explore nearly every possible combination for the board. This gives us a worst-case time complexity of O(9^n), where n is the number of empty cells in the Sudoku puzzle.

The space complexity of this solution is O(1), assuming the input board is the only space consumed, as the algorithm works in place. However, if we consider the recursion stack, the space complexity becomes O(n), where n is the depth of the recursion tree, which is at most the number of empty cells.

### Real-World Applications

Solving Sudoku puzzles is not just a recreational activity. The algorithms and strategies used in Sudoku solvers are applicable in various fields, such as operations research, constraint satisfaction problems, and logic programming. These areas deal with finding solutions to complex problems with numerous constraints, which is comparable to filling a Sudoku board under the game's rules.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

Some common pitfalls and helpful tricks when implementing a Sudoku solver:

- **Not properly checking all constraints:** When checking if a number can be placed in a cell, make sure to correctly examine the corresponding row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. A common mistake is to overlook one of these checks.

- **Inefficient backtracking:** Use backtracking efficiently. Try probable numbers first, which may slightly improve performance. Also, return as soon as the board is solved instead of unnecessary further recursion.

- **Recursion depth:** Python's default recursion limit might be exceeded for deep recursion. You can increase the limit with `sys.setrecursionlimit(new_limit)`, but this is typically not required for Sudoku.

- **Mutability of lists:** Remember that lists are mutable in Python. If you make a copy of the board, use `copy.deepcopy()` to avoid unintended modification of the original board.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem exemplifies a _backtracking algorithm_. Recognizing this pattern can help in solving other constraint satisfaction problems, where you have to find a configuration of variables that satisfies a set of constraints.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems

Here are some LeetCode problems that also use backtracking:

- N-Queens (Problem 51)
- Combination Sum (Problem 39)
- Permutations (Problem 46)
- Subsets (Problem 78)
- Word Search (Problem 79)

Understanding how backtracking works in the Sudoku Solver can greatly assist with these problems since they involve exploring a space of possibilities and backtracking when you reach a dead end. Each of these problems may have specific twists or additional constraints, but the core recursive approach with backtracking to explore possible solutions will be useful in solving them."
38,"LeetCode Problem Number 38 refers to the problem titled ""Count and Say"". The problem is part of the ""String"" category and is known for its distinctive approach to generating sequences of numbers using a descriptive method.

### Problem Statement

The ""Count and Say"" sequence is a sequence of integers where each term is a count of the digits in the previous term. Here's how it works:

- The first term is ""1"".
- Subsequent terms are derived by describing the previous term.
- To describe a term, read it digit by digit, and group consecutive identical digits together (if any), then count the number of digits in each group and append the digit itself.

For example, the term after ""1"" is ""11"" (since there is 'one' '1'), and the term after ""11"" is ""21"" (since there are 'two' '1's).

Your task is to generate the nth term in this sequence.

More formally, the problem can be stated as follows:

Given a positive integer `n`, return the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

### Examples

Here's how the sequence starts:

1.     1                   (""one 1"" or 11)
2.     11                  (""two 1s"" or 21)
3.     21                  (""one 2, then one 1"" or 1211)
4.     1211                (""one 1, one 2, and two 1s"" or 111221)
5.     111221              (""three 1s, two 2s, and one 1"" or 312211)
... and so on.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 1
Output: ""1""
Explanation: This is the base case.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 4
Output: ""1211""
Explanation: For n = 3 the term was ""21"". For n = 4, we say ""one 2, then one 1"", which, as a string, is ""1211"".
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 30`

### Approach to Solving the Problem

The iterative approach to generating the sequence would look like this:

1. Initialize the current term as ""1"", which is the first term in the sequence.
2. For each `n` from 2 to the target `n`, generate the next term by iterating over the current term and grouping consecutive identical digits.
3. In each iteration, use a loop to count consecutive identical digits and append the count and digit to a string that will become the next term.
4. After generating the next term, set it as the current term for the next iteration.
5. Return the current term after the loop completes.

### Python Code Solution

```python
def countAndSay(n):
    current_term = ""1""
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        next_term = """"
        i = 0
        while i < len(current_term):
            count = 1
            while (i + 1 < len(current_term) and
                   current_term[i] == current_term[i + 1]):
                i += 1
                count += 1
            next_term += str(count) + current_term[i]
            i += 1
        current_term = next_term
    return current_term
```

In the above code, we loop n-1 times to generate the nth term. The nested while loop is crucial as it performs the ""count and say"" operation by moving through the current term and grouping identical consecutive numbers.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(mn) where m is the maximum length of the term and n is the input number. The length of the terms can grow exponentially.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m) as we need space to store the current term and the next term, where m is the maximum length of the term.

### Real-World Application

While this problem may seem like a puzzle with no practical use, it actually mirrors situations in run-length encoding and data compression, where similar consecutive elements are counted and recorded to save space.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- One common mistake could be trying to generate the entire sequence up to n. But since we only need the nth term, we should overwrite the current term with the next term at each iteration.
- Ensuring that the inner while loop correctly updates the count and then skips the grouped digits is crucial.
- The problem is an excellent example of an algorithm that requires careful handling of string manipulation.

- LeetCode 14 (Longest Common Prefix)

Understanding ""Count and Say"" helps with understanding these kinds of problems by improving skills such as string manipulation, iterative approaches, and simulating the problem condition."
39,"LeetCode Problem 39 is titled ""Combination Sum"". The problem statement is as follows:

Given an array of distinct integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return a list of all unique combinations of `candidates` where the chosen numbers sum up to `target`. You may return the combinations in any order.

The same number from `candidates` may be chosen an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

It's important to note the following constraints and conditions:

1. The same number can be chosen multiple times.
2. Combinations are unique based on their frequency, not their order.
3. `candidates` contains distinct integers.
4. The target number must be met exactly by the sum of the combination.
5. All numbers, including the target, will be positive integers.

### Solution Strategy

The problem is a classic example of backtracking. The idea is to explore all possible combinations of numbers that add up to the target sum, and once we either find a combination that works or exceed the target sum, we backtrack and try a different combination.

Here's a step-by-step strategy on how to approach the problem:

1. **Sorting (Optional):** First, we can sort the `candidates` array. This isn't necessary for the algorithm to work, but it can help to optimize by allowing us to stop searching further when the current sum exceeds the target sum.

2. **Backtracking Function:** Create a helper function that will be used for backtracking. This function will take the starting index for `candidates`, the current combination of numbers, the remaining sum to achieve the target, and the final result list.

3. **Recursive Cases:**
   - If the remaining sum is zero, a valid combination is found. Add the current combination to the result list.
   - If the remaining sum is negative, since all numbers are positive, there's no need to continue exploring this path.
   - If the remaining sum is positive, iterate over the `candidates` starting from the current index and for each number, add it to the current combination and recursively call the backtracking function with the updated current combination and remaining sum.

4. **Avoiding Duplicates:** Because `candidates` may contain multiple identical elements, we iterate from the current index rather than starting over each time. This helps avoid repeats and ensures each candidate is used only in its respective call stack level.

5. **Base Case:** The backtracking terminates when all combinations have been tried.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Here's what a Python solution using backtracking would look like:

```python
def combinationSum(candidates, target):
    def backtrack(start, combination, total):
        if total == 0:
            result.append(combination[:])  # Make a copy of the current combination
            return
        elif total < 0:
            return  # Backtrack as the sum exceeded the target
        
        for i in range(start, len(candidates)):
            # Include the current candidate and proceed
            combination.append(candidates[i])
            backtrack(i, combination, total - candidates[i])  # Not 'i + 1' because we can reuse the same elements
            combination.pop()  # Backtrack

    candidates.sort()  # Optional for optimization
    result = []
    backtrack(0, [], target)
    return result
```

In the above code:
- `combination` is a list that holds the current selection of numbers.
- `total` is the remaining sum we need to achieve the target.
- `start` ensures that we only use numbers starting from the current index and onwards.
- `backtrack(0, [], target)` initializes the process.

### Complexity Analysis

Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the above solution:

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is O(N^(T/M + 1)), where N is the number of candidates, T is the target sum, and M is the minimal value among the candidates. This is because in the worst-case scenario, the algorithm needs to explore each combination of candidates up to the point where the sum equals the target.
  
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(T/M) for the recursion stack. In the worst-case scenario, where we get the target sum by adding the smallest number M each time, the depth of the recursion can go up to T/M. Plus, the space needed to store the result.

### Real-World Applications

The ""Combination Sum"" problem is similar to many real-world problems where you have to find all possible ways to achieve a certain goal with given resources or constraints. Some examples include:
- Finding all ways to provide change for a given amount using available denominations.
- Exploring all combinations of ingredients to achieve a specific nutritional value in a meal plan.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

Common pitfalls include:
- Not backtracking correctly, which can lead to missing some combinations or creating duplicates.
- Not handling the base cases properly, leading to infinite recursion or incorrect results.
  
Tricks to optimize or improve the algorithm:
- Sorting candidates to quickly stop the search when the sum exceeds the target.
- Using iterative approaches instead of recursion for environments where recursion depth is a limitation.

### Problem Pattern Identification

Recognizing that this problem involves building combinations and that each choice leads to a new set of subsequent choices is critical. It is a variation of a subset or combination generation problem, which is commonly solved by backtracking.

- LeetCode 46: ""Permutations""
- LeetCode 77: ""Combinations""

Each of these problems requires some kind of backtracking or combination/permutation generation but with different constraints and requirements."
40,"LeetCode Problem #40 is titled ""Combination Sum II"". Let me give you a comprehensive analysis and explanation of this problem.

## Extensive Problem Breakdown

In this problem, you are given a collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target). The task is to find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sum to the target.

Each number in candidates may only be used once in the combination. It's important to note that the solution set must not include duplicate combinations.

Here are the main points to understand:
- The same number can be chosen from candidates multiple times, but each number is unique within a particular combination.
- The order of numbers within a combination does not matter; `[2,3,6]` and `[3,2,6]` are considered the same combination and therefore only one should be included in the solution.
- The candidates array may contain duplicates.
- The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
- The candidate numbers can be in any order, and it doesn't matter which order you use to achieve the target sum.

## In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, we need to explore all possible combinations of candidate numbers that sum up to the target. However, to avoid duplicates we have to sort the array first and then skip over duplicate elements during the combination construction.

A common approach suitable for this problem is to use backtracking. This is a method of solving computational problems by incrementally building candidates to the solutions and abandoning candidates (""backtracking"") as soon as it is determined that they cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

### Steps for the Backtracking Approach:

1. Sort the candidate array to handle duplicates easily.
2. Create a recursive function that takes the current combination, the current sum, the remaining candidates, and the current starting index.
3. If the current sum is equal to the target, add the current combination to the result list.
4. Iterate through the remaining candidates, starting from the current index. For each candidate:
   - Skip duplicates.
   - Include the current candidate in the current combination.
   - Recurse with the remaining candidates and the updated current sum.
   - ""Backtrack"" by removing the current candidate from the current combination.
5. The base case for the recursion is when the current sum is equal to the target.

This approach ensures that we explore each unique set of numbers that could potentially sum up to the target, while skipping over duplicates to avoid the same combination being considered more than once.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's implement the backtracking approach in Python:

```python
def combinationSum2(candidates, target):
    def backtrack(start, target, path):
        if target == 0:
            result.append(path)
            return
        for i in range(start, len(candidates)):
            if i > start and candidates[i] == candidates[i-1]:  # skip duplicates
                continue
            if candidates[i] > target:  # early stop
                break
            backtrack(i + 1, target - candidates[i], path + [candidates[i]])

    candidates.sort()  # sort the array to handle duplicates
    result = []
    backtrack(0, target, [])
    return result
```

Let's break down the code above:

- We first sort `candidates` to ensure that duplicates are next to each other and can be easily skipped.
- `result` is the list that will hold all of our unique combinations.
- The `backtrack` function is a helper function defined within `combinationSum2`. It is used to generate combinations recursively.
    - `start` is the index at which to start considering candidates to avoid reusing elements.
    - `target` is the remaining sum we need to achieve.
    - `path` is the current combination being constructed.
- If the `target` becomes `0`, it means the current `path` sums up to the desired target, so we add a copy of `path` to `result`.
- We loop through `candidates` starting from the `start` index to avoid duplicates.
    - If the value at index `i` is the same as the previous value (and it's not the start index), we `continue` to skip it.
    - If the value at index `i` is greater than the remaining `target`, we can `break` from the loop since the candidates are sorted and further values will also be too big.
    - Otherwise, we call `backtrack` recursively, passing `i+1` as the new start index, `target - candidates[i]` as the new target, and `path + [candidates[i]]` as the new path including the current candidate.

## Elaborate Examples

Let's look at a detailed example:

Suppose we have:
- `candidates = [10, 1, 2, 7, 6, 1, 5]`
- `target = 8`

And we expect:
- `result = [[1, 1, 6], [1, 2, 5], [1, 7], [2, 6]]`

Here's what happens behind the scenes:
1. Sort `candidates` to `[1, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 10]`.
2. Start with an empty `path` and target `8`.
3. Try `1`, which leads to `[1]`, target becomes `7`.
4. Recurse, and try another `1`, but avoid the duplicate. Continue with `2`, which leads to `[1, 2]`, target becomes `5`.
5. Keep recursing and finding valid combinations, making sure to skip duplicates and not use elements beyond the target.

Through this backtracking approach, we systematically explore each candidate, backtrack when necessary, and ensure we account for each unique combination that sums to `target`.

## Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(2^N) in the worst case, where N is the length of the candidates array. This complexity arises because for each candidate, we have two choices: either include it in the current combination or exclude it, forming a binary choice tree.

The space complexity is O(N) because, in the worst case, the recursion stack could go as deep as the number of elements in `candidates`, plus the space needed for storing the current combination.

## Real-World Applications

Problems like ""Combination Sum II"" have real-world applications in areas such as financial computations (for instance, finding all possible combinations of transactions that sum to a specific amount), resource allocation, constraint satisfaction problems in artificial intelligence, and many other domains where a specific set of conditions must be met without redundancy.

## Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Duplicate handling is critical. You must sort the array and be careful about skipping over duplicates.
- It is inefficient to generate all combinations and then filter for unique ones; much better to avoid creating duplicates from the start.
- Remember to 'backtrack' properly by undoing any changes made before the recursive call when you return from it.

## Problem Pattern Identification

The pattern recognized in this problem is backtracking. It is useful for decision-making problems where constraints need to be satisfied, and is commonly used in constraint satisfaction, permutations, combinations, and subset problems.

41,"LeetCode Problem #41 is titled ""First Missing Positive."" This problem is both challenging and interesting, as it requires you to operate in linear time and constant space. Here's the problem statement, broken down into its different parts:

### Problem Statement:

Given an unsorted integer array `nums`, find the smallest missing positive integer. The goal is to implement a function:

```python
def firstMissingPositive(nums: List[int]) -> int:
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^5`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The difficulty of the problem lies in the constraints:
- You cannot sort the array, as sorting would take O(n log n) time, and we need a linear time solution (O(n)).
- You cannot use extra space, so auxiliary storage like hash tables or sets is not allowed, as that would contravene the constant space requirement.

Your task is to come up with a strategy that can identify the smallest missing positive integer within these tight constraints.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

The key insight for solving this problem is realizing that the size of the array `n` determines the range of the first missing positive integer, i.e., it must be between `1` and `n+1`. This is because, in the worst-case scenario where the array contains all positive integers from `1 to n` without any duplicates, the first missing positive will be `n+1`.

The strategy involves a clever use of the input array itself to mark the presence of numbers. Here's how you can approach it:

1. **Filtering out non-positive numbers and numbers larger than `n`:**
   First, replace every negative number, zero, and number larger than `n` with a number that is outside the range of 1 to `n`, for example, `n+1`.

2. **Marking Presence:**
   Iterate through the array, and for each number `nums[i]` we encounter, we can mark the presence of the number `nums[i]` by negating the `(nums[nums[i] - 1])` element if it's positive. We use `nums[i] - 1` as the index because array indices start at 0.

3. **Find the First Missing Positive:**
   After the previous step, the first positive number in the array is the first missing positive. If all numbers are negative, then the answer is `n+1`.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

We can now translate that strategy into Python code. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step breakdown of the code:

```python
def firstMissingPositive(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(nums)

    # 1. Filter the necessary numbers
    for i in range(n):
        if nums[i] <= 0 or nums[i] > n:
            nums[i] = n + 1

    # 2. Marking the presence of a number
    for i in range(n):
        num = abs(nums[i])
        if num <= n:
            nums[num - 1] = -abs(nums[num - 1])

    # 3. Find the first missing positive
    for i in range(n):
        if nums[i] > 0:
            return i + 1

    return n + 1
```

Each line in the block has the following purpose:
- We get the length of the array `n`.
- In the first loop, we replace all non-useful numbers with `n+1`.
- In the second loop, we use the absolute value `abs(nums[i])` to leave the sign of numbers we have already used as markers unchanged and then negate the index that represents the value of `num - 1` if it's positive.
- In the third loop, we look for the first positive number, which indicates that the index plus 1 is the smallest missing positive number.
- If all numbers are negative, then the answer is `n+1`; the array contains all numbers from `1 to n`.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's walk through an example:

Suppose `nums = [3, 4, -1, 1]`.

- After the filtering step, `nums` becomes `[3, 4, 5, 1]`.
- The marking step negates the numbers at indices `2`, `3`, and `0`, resulting in `[-3, 4, -5, -1]`.
- The third step identifies `4` as the first positive number, so the first missing positive integer is `2` (`4-2 = 2`).

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), as each of the steps (filtering, marking, and identifying the first missing positive) involves a single pass through the array.

The space complexity is O(1) since we've modified the input array in place and haven't used any extra space proportional to the input size.

### Real-World Applications:

This problem is reminiscent of data cleansing operations where you need to validate records and fill in missing data with defaults based on the constraints of the dataset. Identifying missing entries efficiently is a common task in data analysis and database management.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- One common pitfall is attempting to sort the array or use extra space, which the problem constraints do not allow.
- A nuanced trick in this problem is the use of the input array itself for marking, which saves space.
- Be careful to handle negative indices and out-of-bounds errors when using array indices to mark presence.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem employs a pattern often referred to as ""index mapping,"" where the indices are used to map to the value and hence keep track of the presence of elements.

42,"LeetCode Problem 42 is titled ""Trapping Rain Water"". This is a classic problem in the category of arrays and two-pointer technique. It also involves some understanding of dynamic programming concepts.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem statement is as follows:

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

The input is an array of integers where each element represents the height of a bar in the elevation map. The challenge is to determine how much rainwater can be trapped between these bars given the variation in their heights.

The subtle nuances of this problem include understanding that:
- Water can only be trapped between bars that are of non-zero height.
- Trapped water above any bar cannot exceed the height of the smallest bar that can hold the water from overflowing.
- The complexity of the problem comes from calculating the volume of water that could be trapped in a varying landscape where elevation changes dramatically.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, we need to find, for every element in the array, the maximum height bar to its left and to its right. The amount of water each bar can trap is equal to the difference between the height of the bar itself and the shorter of the two maximum heights found on either side (since the water will flow over on the lower side).

There are several approaches to solve this problem:

1. **Brute Force Method**:
   - For each element, find the highest bar on its left and right, which involves nested iterations.
   - The time complexity of this method would be O(n^2), and the space complexity would be O(1).

2. **Dynamic Programming Method**:
   - Precompute the highest bar on the left and right of every bar using two separate arrays.
   - Time complexity reduces to O(n) since every element only need be visited twice, once for filling each precomputed array.
   - The space complexity, however, increases to O(n) due to the extra space taken up by the two arrays.

3. **Using Stacks**:
   - Use a stack to store the bars' indices, and when you find a bar that is taller than the one at the top of the stack, calculate the water that can be trapped between these two bars.
   - This method also has a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n).

4. **Two Pointer Approach**:
   - Use two pointers, one from the start and one from the end of the array, and move them towards each other.
   - Keep track of the max height seen so far from both the start and end.
   - Depending on which side has a smaller max height, move that pointer towards the center.
   - Calculate the trapped water as you go.
   - This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it the most efficient solution.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

We will follow the Two Pointer Approach here. Let's write down the code and then we will go through each line to explain how it works."
43,"LeetCode Problem 43 is titled ""Multiply Strings."" This problem falls under the category of string manipulation and is designed to test one's understanding of basic arithmetic operations without using built-in language features for handling large numbers which would normally make this task trivial.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The problem statement is as follows: Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represented as strings, return the product of `num1` and `num2`, also represented as a string.

Notable constraints and nuances of the problem:
- The length of both `num1` and `num2` is < 200.
- The numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
- You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

This problem essentially asks you to implement the multiplication of two numbers exactly as it is taught in elementary school, where you multiply each digit of one number by each digit of the other number and sum the intermediate results appropriately.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
Since the direct conversion of strings to integers is not allowed, we need to simulate the multiplication process.

The general algorithm:
1. Initialize an array `result` that can hold the maximum possible number of digits in the output (length of `num1` + length of `num2`).
2. Iterate through each digit in `num1` and `num2` in nested loops, multiplying the digits at the current indices.
3. Update the `result` array at the corresponding indices.
4. Handle carry over if the multiplication results in a number greater than 9.
5. Convert the `result` array into the final string, taking care to skip any leading zeros.

This approach ensures that each digit is handled properly according to its place value.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Let's implement the solution in Python, breaking down each step:

```python
def multiply(num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
    if num1 == ""0"" or num2 == ""0"":
        return ""0""
    
    # Initialize result array with zeros
    result = [0] * (len(num1) + len(num2))
    
    # Reverse strings to make it easier to handle place values
    num1, num2 = num1[::-1], num2[::-1]
    
    # Multiply each digit from num1 with each digit from num2
    for i in range(len(num1)):
        for j in range(len(num2)):
            result[i + j] += int(num1[i]) * int(num2[j])
            # Handle carry over to the next digit
            result[i + j + 1] += result[i + j] // 10
            result[i + j] %= 10
    
    # Remove leading zeros and convert list to string
    while result[-1] == 0:
        result.pop()
    result = result[::-1]  # Reverse back to original order
    
    return ''.join(map(str, result))
```

Step by step explanation:
- We check for the easy case. If either of the strings is ""0"", the product is also ""0"".
- We initialize an array of zeros with a length equal to `len(num1) + len(num2)` since it's the maximum possible length of the product.
- We reverse both strings to align their least significant digits (1's place) starting from the array's 0th index.
- We use nested loops to iterate over each digit of `num1` and `num2`, multiply them, and store the result in the `result` array, taking into account the indices which represent the place value.
- We handle carry over by adding the value at `result[i + j]` to the next position `(i + j + 1)`, and then use the modulus operator to keep only the single-digit in `result[i + j]`.
- After the multiplication, we remove any leading zeros that are not part of the actual number.
- We reverse the list back to its original number order.
- Finally, we join the integers in the `result` array into a string.

### Elaborate Examples:
Let's take num1=""123"" and num2=""456"" as an example. The multiplication operation would be similar to:

```
  1 2 3
x 4 5 6
-------
  7 3 8  (123 * 6)
6 1 5    (123 * 5, shifted one position to the left)
4 9 2 0  (123 * 4, shifted two positions to the left)
-------
5 6 0 8 8
```

After processing the carries, we arrive at the final result ""56088"".

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
Time complexity:
- There are two nested loops, each iterating at most 200 times since the maximum length of num1 and num2 is 200.
- This results in a time complexity of O(n * m), where n is the length of `num1` and m is the length of `num2`.

Space complexity:
- We are using a result array whose length is n + m, where n is the length of `num1` and m is the length of `num2`.
- Hence, the space complexity is O(n + m).

### Real-World Applications:
Simulating string multiplication as demonstrated in this problem can be highly useful in systems or programming languages that do not support large numbers natively. Applications that deal with cryptography, scientific computations, and financial calculations often require precise handling of very large numbers, making string-based arithmetic a useful approach.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- Forgetting to handle the carry might be one of the most common mistakes.
- Failing to remove the leading zeros could result in an incorrect representation of the number.
- Accidentally mutating the `result` array in incorrect indices might skew the final result.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem is a classic case of simulating arithmetical operations manually, a common pattern where you have to implement basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division from scratch.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:
Similar problems that involve manual arithmetic operations include:
- LeetCode Problem 2: Add Two Numbers.
- LeetCode Problem 415: Add Strings.
- LeetCode Problem 67: Add Binary.
- LeetCode Problem 66: Plus One.

Each of these problems requires a manual manipulation of numbers (usually represented as linked lists or strings), making the skills learned here transferable to those challenges.

By understanding and mastering this problem, you will be much better equipped to handle not just multiplication of large integers represented as strings, but other mathematical operations implemented in a non-traditional manner as well."
44,"LeetCode Problem 44 is titled ""Wildcard Matching"". This is a classic problem of pattern matching, which is quite common in text processing as well as in designing interpreters and compilers. The problem statement is as follows:

Problem Statement:
Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*' where:

- '?' Matches any single character.
- '*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Example 1:
Input: s = ""aa"", p = ""a""
Output: false
Explanation: ""a"" does not match the entire string ""aa"".

Example 2:
Input: s = ""aa"", p = ""*""
Output: true
Explanation: '*' matches any sequence, including an empty sequence or ""aa"".

Example 3:
Input: s = ""cb"", p = ""?a""
Output: false
Explanation: '?' matches 'c', but the second letter is 'b' which does not match 'a'.

In this problem, you are required to determine if the pattern matches the string exactly. This is a more complex version of regular expression matching, with the wildcard '*' playing a key role in the problem's complexity.

**Extensive Problem Breakdown:**
The key aspect of wildcard matching is handling the '*' wildcard, which can be particularly tricky because it can match an arbitrary number of characters including zero. This means that one has to consider multiple possibilities at each stage when a '*' is encountered.

Additionally, '?' wildcard requires a match of exactly one character, which simplifies the problem to some degree but still adds complexity when combined with '*' characters.

**In-Depth Solution Rationale:**
There are several ways to approach this problem, ranging from backtracking to dynamic programming:

1. **Backtracking:**
   - You can iterate over the string and pattern simultaneously, and whenever you encounter a '*', you try to match it with zero or more characters.
   - Backtracking occurs when a character following the '*' in the pattern does not match the string, prompting the algorithm to try a different number of characters for the wildcard.

2. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Implementing a bottom-up dynamic programming approach generally yields a more efficient solution.
   - You create a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents whether the first `i` characters in the string match the first `j` characters in the pattern.
   - You initialize `dp[0][0]` to `True`, meaning an empty pattern matches an empty string.
   - You fill in the table using the rules based on whether you encounter a '?', '*' or literal match.

**Detailed Python Code Explanation:**
We'll commonly see a solution in Python using dynamic programming due to its efficiency.

I'll provide a code example below and explain it in detail."
45,"LeetCode Problem #45 is titled ""Jump Game II."" This problem is focused on finding the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index of an array, starting from the first index.

Let's begin with an extensive problem breakdown:

### Problem Statement

Given an array of non-negative integers `nums`, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array. Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position. Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

### Input

- An array `nums` of non-negative integers.

### Output

- An integer representing the minimum number of jumps to reach the last index.

### Constraints

- The length of `nums` is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- Each element `nums[i]` is in the range `[0, 1000]`.

### Nuances to Consider

- If the element at the current index has a value of 0, you cannot move forward from that position.
- It's important to note that reaching the last index means that you can either land exactly on it or surpass it.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The problem can initially seem like a backtracking or dynamic programming problem, where you might be tempted to try every possible combination of jumps. However, this approach leads to a time complexity that can be too high to be acceptable for the given constraints.

A more efficient solution uses the greedy algorithm approach. The basic idea is to iterate through the array while maintaining a range (or ""window"") of indices that can be reached with the current number of jumps. Within this range, the next range is calculated based on the maximum reach from these indices. This strategy allows you to increase the jump count only when it's necessary to advance the current range to reach the last index.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Iterate through the array while keeping track of the following:
   - The current farthest distance you can reach (`farthest`).
   - The end of the current range to jump (`current_jump_end`).
   - The number of jumps taken so far (`jumps`).

2. While iterating, for each index `i`:
   - Update `farthest` with the maximum between its current value and `i + nums[i]` to know how far we may reach from the current position.
   - If `i` is at the `current_jump_end`, it's time to make another jump:
     - Increment the jump counter `jumps`.
     - Update `current_jump_end` with the value of `farthest` because that's how far we can reach with the current `jumps`.

3. The loop continues until the end of the array is within the range defined by `current_jump_end`.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's now look at a Python code solution implementing the above approach:

```python
def jump(nums):
    jumps = current_jump_end = farthest = 0
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):  # We don't need to consider the last element
        farthest = max(farthest, i + nums[i])
        if i == current_jump_end:
            jumps += 1
            current_jump_end = farthest
    return jumps
```

- `jumps` starts at 0 because no jumps have been made initially.
- `current_jump_end` and `farthest` both start at 0, representing the current range of indices that can be reached.
- The loop goes until `len(nums) - 1` because when we reach the last element, we don't need to jump anymore.
- `farthest` is updated with the maximum distance possible from the current index.
- If `i` reaches `current_jump_end`, it means we have to jump again to continue, so we increment `jumps` and update `current_jump_end` to `farthest`.
- After the loop completes, `jumps` holds the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index.

### Elaborate Examples

Consider this array: `[2, 3, 1, 1, 4]`.

- Start at index 0, jump range is `[0, 2]` (since `nums[0] = 2`), `farthest` is 2, and `jumps` is 0.
- The next jump must land within `[1, 2]`. The farthest we can get from these is index 4 (since `nums[1] = 3`), so `farthest` becomes 4.
- Since we reached the end of the current range, we must jump: `jumps` becomes 1, and `current_jump_end` is updated to 4.
- Now that we can reach the last index, we stop the process. The minimum number of jumps needed is 1.

### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. Despite the nested calculations within the loop, we don't re-visit elements, as we're always moving forward through the array.

The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space (for the variables `jumps`, `current_jump_end`, and `farthest`).

### Real-World Applications

The problem can be viewed as an abstraction for various real-life situations where we need to reach a goal in the minimum number of steps or stages, such as:

- Network routing, where we want to minimize the number of hops between devices.
- Decision-making processes, where each ""jump"" represents a decision that brings us closer to our objective.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- One common pitfall is to try to handle the last element in the same way as others, leading to an off-by-one error.
- A useful trick is to iterate until `len(nums) - 1`, as the last element does not require a jump.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem follows the pattern of greedy algorithms where making the locally optimal choice at each step may lead to the global optimum. Recognizing this pattern is helpful in solving similar problems that require finding optimal solutions step-by-step.

46,"LeetCode problem number 46 refers to the ""Permutations"" problem. In this problem, you are given a list of distinct integers, and you are required to return all possible permutations of these integers. This problem fits into the category of ""Backtracking,"" which is a systematic way to iterate through all possible configurations of a search space.

Here's a thorough analysis of the problem and how to approach it:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The problem statement is quite straightforward: Given an array `nums` of distinct integers, return all possible permutations. 

A permutation of an array is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order. For `nums` with `n` distinct elements, there are `n!` (n factorial) possible permutations. For example, `[1, 2, 3]` has the following permutations:

```
[1, 2, 3]
[1, 3, 2]
[2, 1, 3]
[2, 3, 1]
[3, 1, 2]
[3, 2, 1]
```

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
The problem can be solved using backtracking, which is the primary approach for generating all possible configurations of a set. The concept behind backtracking is to build permutations incrementally and backtrack as soon as we determine that the current permutation cannot possibly lead to a complete solution.

Here are the steps for this approach:
1. At each recursion level, we iterate through the elements of the array.
2. We make a choice (i.e., select an element for the current position in the permutation).
3. We recurse to construct the subsequent elements of the permutation.
4. Once we reach a state where the permutation is complete, we add it to our result list.
5. We then backtrack to change the last choice made and explore new choices, continuing this process until all permutations are enumerated.

To avoid selecting the same element multiple times, we keep track of which elements we've used in the current permutation array.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Here's a Python function to solve the problem using backtracking:
```python
def permute(nums):
    def backtrack(first=0):
        # if all integers are used up
        if first == n:
            output.append(nums[:])
        for i in range(first, n):
            # place i-th integer first
            # in the current permutation
            nums[first], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[first]
            # use next integers to complete the permutations
            backtrack(first + 1)
            # backtrack
            nums[first], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[first]

    n = len(nums)
    output = []
    backtrack()
    return output
```

In the code above:
- `backtrack(first=0)` is the recursive function that will generate permutations. `first` represents the index of the first integer to consider for the current permutation.
- If `first == n`, it means we have a complete permutation in `nums`, so we add a copy of it to `output`.
- The loop `for i in range(first, n)` iterates to decide what integer will be placed in the position `first`.
- We swap `nums[first]` and `nums[i]` to put the integer `i` in the first position and then recurse with `first + 1`.
- After recursion, we swap back `nums[first]` and `nums[i]` to backtrack and undo the last choice, allowing us to explore a new choice in the next iteration.

### Elaborate Examples:
Letâ€™s take the example `[1,2,3]`:
1. Initially, `first` is `0`.
2. We swap the `first` element with each element (including itself), which doesn't change the array at all in the first iteration.
3. Then we call `backtrack(first + 1)`, which is `backtrack(1)`.
4. This process continues until `first == n`, indicating a complete permutation.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: `O(n!)` because there are `n!` permutations for an array of size `n`, and we will generate all of them.
- Space Complexity: `O(n)` due to the recursion stack depth, which goes at most `n` levels deep.

### Real-World Applications:
Permutation generation is used in various applications like generating different arrangements for seating, scheduling, and in algorithm problems related to searching and sorting. They're also used in cryptography and game theory.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
One common pitfall is to not create a copy of the permutation when adding it to the output list. If you add the reference to `nums` instead of `nums[:]`, all entries in the result list will reference the same list object. Consequently, they will all reflect the final state of `nums`, not the unique permutations.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
Recognizing the necessity for backtracking is the key pattern in this problem. Anytime you have to explore all possible configurations, with the possibility of reversing decisions, you're likely dealing with a backtracking problem.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:
This problem is closely related to other backtracking problems such as:
- Subsets (LeetCode Problem 78)
- Combination Sum (LeetCode Problem 39)
- Palindrome Permutation II (LeetCode Problem 267)
- Permutations II (LeetCode Problem 47), where the input might contain duplicates, requiring additional logic to skip over the same numbers.

Each of these problems involves a similar recursive structure that builds up a solution incrementally, with the same requirement to backtrack and try different combinations or orderings. The skills acquired in solving the Permutations problem can be transferred to solve these related challenges."
47,"LeetCode Problem 47 is titled ""Permutations II"". This problem requires you to generate all possible unique permutations of a collection of numbers that may contain duplicates.

## Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem statement gives you an array of integers, and the goal is to return all possible unique permutations. If two permutations are identical, you should include only one of them in your result. This introduces a complication compared to generating permutations for a distinct set of numbers, as you must ensure that permutations are unique even when the input set has duplicates.

The input is a list of integers, which could potentially include both positive and negative numbers, as well as the value zero. There are no constraints provided on the range of the integer values. The problem does not specify any particular order in which to return the permutations.

## In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, you need to generate permutations efficiently while avoiding duplicates. Common approaches to this problem include:

1. Backtracking: This is a classic approach for generating permutations. However, to account for duplicates, you must add logic to skip over duplicate values to ensure that only unique permutations are generated.

2. Using a Counter: Count the occurrences of each number using collections.Counter or a similar data structure. Generate permutations by selecting numbers based on their remaining counts, which ensures that duplicate numbers are treated as distinct when generating permutations.

3. Iterative Generation: Start with one element and iteratively add more elements, inserting them at all possible positions. Keep track of previously generated permutations and ensure that you do not create duplicates when adding a new element.

Among these, backtracking is a widely preferred method because it is a standard technique for exploring all possible configurations of a set of choices, which is exactly what is called for in generating permutations.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation:

To implement the backtracking method in Python, we will follow these steps:

- Define a recursive function to generate permutations.
- Use a list to keep track of elements that have not been used yet, along with a set to avoid duplicate permutations at each level of recursion.
- Sort the input array to ensure we can skip duplicates efficiently.
- Recursively build permutations and backtrack when necessary.

Let's further break down the Python code using the backtracking approach.

```python
from typing import List

def permuteUnique(nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    def backtrack(start, end):
        if start == end:
            result.append(nums[:])
            return
        seen = set()
        for i in range(start, end):
            # If the number has already been used in this position, skip
            if nums[i] in seen:
                continue
            seen.add(nums[i])
            # Swap the current element with the start element
            nums[start], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[start]
            # Recurse on the next part of the array
            backtrack(start + 1, end)
            # Backtrack: restore the array
            nums[start], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[start]

    result = []
    nums.sort()  # Sort the array to handle duplicates
    backtrack(0, len(nums))
    return result
```

Now, let's break down the code above piece by piece:

- `permuteUnique(nums: List[int])`: This is the main function that you call with the list of numbers to get the permutations.
- `backtrack(start, end)`: A helper function defined within `permuteUnique`, which is used for the backtracking algorithm.
- `if start == end`: This checks if the recursion has considered all elements. If so, a valid permutation (`nums[:]`) is added to the result list.
- `seen = set()`: A set is used to remember which elements have been used at the current level of the recursion to avoid duplicates.
- `for i in range(start, end)`: A loop to try placing each element in the `start` position.
- `if nums[i] in seen: continue`: If the value has already been considered for the current `start` position, we skip it to prevent duplicates.
- `seen.add(nums[i])`: The current value is added to the `seen` set.
- `nums[start], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[start]`: Swap the current element with the one at the `start` position to fix it in the current position for the permutation being built.
- `backtrack(start + 1, end)`: Recursively call `backtrack` for the next position.
- `nums[start], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[start]`: Backtrack by restoring the original order of elements.
- `result = []`: A list to store the resulting permutations.
- `nums.sort()`: Sorting the `nums` list at the start ensures that duplicates are adjacent, aiding in duplicate detection and skipping.
- `backtrack(0, len(nums))`: Begin the backtracking process with the entire range of the `nums` list.
- `return result`: After all permutations are generated, return the result list.

## Elaborate Examples:

For instance, if the input is `[1, 1, 2]`, the following unique permutations should be returned:
```
[
  [1, 1, 2],
  [1, 2, 1],
  [2, 1, 1]
]
```

Notice that although the number '1' appears twice in the input, each permutation is unique.

## Thorough Complexity Analysis:

The time and space complexity of this algorithm are harder to directly calculate due to the involvement of duplicates.

- Time Complexity: In the worst case, when all numbers are distinct, the time complexity is O(n * n!), as there are n! permutations and it takes O(n) time to store each one. However, duplicates can reduce the number of permutations, improving the time complexity in practice.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(n * n!), which includes the space needed to store all unique permutations and the space for the recursion call stack. The space needed for the `seen` set and the temporary arrays created during the swapping of elements is proportional to the height of the recursion tree, which is O(n).

Despite these complexities, please be aware that the generation of permutations is an intrinsically expensive operation, and this algorithm is as efficient as it can be for this type of problem given its combinatorial nature.

## Real-World Applications:

Permutation algorithms have several real-world applications. They are used in generating various combinations of items, such as in password cracking, generating test cases, solving puzzles (like Sudoku), and in optimization problems where you need to explore different configurations or arrangements.

## Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Avoiding duplicates is a common pitfall. By sorting the `nums` array and using a `seen` set, we can prevent the generation of duplicate permutations.
- Itâ€™s essential to make a deep copy (`nums[:]`) of the current state when adding a permutation to the result list, rather than a reference, to avoid altering the saved permutations during backtracking.
- The space complexity can be deceptive. It's easy to overlook the space used by the recursion stack and temporary structures like the `seen` set.
- When swapping elements for backtracking, make sure to swap them back to restore the original state before the next iteration.

## Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem pattern is characterized by the need to explore all possible configurations or combinations, which typically suggests using backtracking to generate permutations or combinations while avoiding duplicates.

48,"LeetCode Problem 48 is named ""Rotate Image"". This is a medium-difficulty problem that asks you to rotate an `n x n` 2D matrix representing an image by 90 degrees (clockwise). You need to do this rotation in-place, which means modifying the matrix directly without using another matrix for the operation.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

Given an `n x n` 2D matrix, each element in the matrix represents a pixel in an image. The challenge is to rotate the image by 90 degrees clockwise. A key requirement is that the rotation must be performed in-place, meaning that you should not allocate another matrix to perform the rotation and then copy it back.

When rotating the image by 90 degrees clockwise:
- The first row of the original matrix becomes the last column of the rotated matrix.
- The second row becomes the second-to-last column, and so on.
- Each element's new position corresponds to a specific pattern that can be described using matrix indices.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To rotate the matrix in place, we can break down the problem into two steps:

1. **Transpose the matrix**: Transposing means flipping the matrix over its diagonal. After this operation, rows become columns and columns become rows. In terms of indices, the item at position `[i][j]` swaps with the item at position `[j][i]`.
   
2. **Reverse each row**: After transposing the matrix, each row is then reversed. The first element in a row becomes the last and vice versa. This effectively results in a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

Why do we use this two-step approach? Because it aligns with the in-place constraint by allowing us to directly mutate the input matrix in a systematic fashion that achieves the required rotation.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

```python
def rotate(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)  # Get the size of the matrix (assuming n x n).

    # Transpose the matrix.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            # Swap the elements at position [i][j] and [j][i].
            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
    
    # Reverse each row to complete the rotation.
    for i in range(n):
        matrix[i].reverse()  # Or use slicing: matrix[i] = matrix[i][::-1]

    # No need to return anything as we modify the matrix in-place.
```

Let's break this down:

- We iterate over each row `i` and each column `j` starting from `i` to the end. This `j` starting from `i` ensures that we don't swap the elements twice.
- We use tuple unpacking to swap elements in place (Pythonic way).
- After transposing, we reverse each row which can be done using the `reverse()` method or slicing.

### Elaborate Examples:

Suppose we have an initial matrix:

```
[
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
```

1. After transposing, it becomes:

```
[
  [1, 4, 7],
  [2, 5, 8],
  [3, 6, 9]
]
```

2. After reversing each row, it becomes the final rotated matrix:

```
[
  [7, 4, 1],
  [8, 5, 2],
  [9, 6, 3]
]
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: O(N^2), where N is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix. We visit each element once during the transpose and once more during the row reversal.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we perform the rotation in place without using extra space for another matrix.

### Real-World Applications:

Rotating images is a common operation in image processing, graphic editors, and computer vision applications. Understanding how to perform such operations efficiently in-place is crucial for resource-constrained environments or real-time systems.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Forgetting the in-place requirement could lead to a simpler but incorrect solution that uses extra space.
- Mixing up rows and columns during the transposition or reversal could lead to errors.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem exemplifies an in-place transformation technique, which is useful in various other problems that involve manipulating arrays or matrices without using additional memory.

49,"LeetCode problem number 49 is titled ""Group Anagrams"". This problem is in the category of Hash Table and Sorting algorithms. Below is a detailed analysis of the problem, encompassing every aspect as requires an in-depth explanation.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
The problem statement can be summarized as follows: You are given an array of strings (`strs`), and you are required to group the anagrams together. Two strings are anagrams of each other if the characters of one string can be rearranged to form the other string. The order of output does not matter.

For example, the strings ""eat"", ""tea"", and ""ate"" are all anagrams of each other and therefore should be grouped together in the same sub-array in the output list.

Some nuances of the problem include:
- Each inner list (sub-array) of the output should contain a group of anagrams.
- No characters are repeated within a single string (though this does not change the anagram grouping).
- Anagrams are case-sensitive, meaning ""nat"" and ""tan"" are anagrams, but ""nat"" and ""TAN"" are not.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
To solve this problem, we can employ various strategies. Common approaches include:

1. **Sorting Based**: For two strings to be anagrams, their sorted characters should be identical. Therefore, we could sort each string in `strs` and use the sorted string as a key in a hash map (dictionary). Each value in this dictionary would be a list of strings that are anagrams of each other.

2. **Count Based**: Instead of sorting, we could also count the frequency of each character in a string and use that as a key. For example, the key for ""eat"" can be a tuple like `(1,0,0,...,1,...,1,...0)` where each position represents a character and the associated count.

Both approaches guarantee that anagrams will be grouped under the same key in the hash map.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
Let's use the Sorting Based approach to provide a detailed Python code explanation.

```python
def groupAnagrams(strs):
    # This dictionary will store a list of anagrams for a sorted string representation.
    anagrams = {}
    
    for s in strs:
        # Sort each string to use as the key
        sorted_s = ''.join(sorted(s))
        
        # If the sorted string is not in the dictionary, add it with the current string as the first element of the list
        if sorted_s not in anagrams:
            anagrams[sorted_s] = [s]
        else:
            # If the sorted string exists as a key, append the current string to the associated list
            anagrams[sorted_s].append(s)
    
    # Return the lists of anagrams from the dictionary values
    return list(anagrams.values())
```

Each line of the code has specific importance:

- `anagrams = {}`: Initializes the hash map (dictionary) that will store groups of anagrams.

- `for s in strs`: Iterates over each string in the input list.

- `sorted_s = ''.join(sorted(s))`: Sorts the characters of the string and then rejoins them to form the key.

- `if sorted_s not in anagrams` checks whether this sorted version of a string has been encountered before.

- `anagrams[sorted_s] = [s]`: If not, create a new entry in the dictionary.

- `anagrams[sorted_s].append(s)`: If the sorted string has been encountered, we append the current string to the existing list.

- `return list(anagrams.values())`: Finally, we return just the values of the dictionary, which are the groups of anagrams.

### Elaborate Examples
Example 1:
Input: `strs = [""eat"", ""tea"", ""tan"", ""ate"", ""nat"", ""bat""]`
Output: A possible solution is `[[""bat""], [""nat"", ""tan""], [""ate"", ""eat"", ""tea""]]`. Note that the arrays could be in any order.

Example 2:
Input: `strs = [""""]`
Output: `[[""""]]` as there is only one string, which is an empty string.

Example 3:
Input: `strs = [""a""]`
Output: `[[""a""]]` as there is only one string with one character.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
For the Sorting Based approach:

- **Time Complexity**: Sorting each string takes `O(k log k)` timeâ€”where `k` is the maximum length of a string in `strs`. We do this for each of the `n` strings, so the total time complexity is `O(n * k log k)`.

- **Space Complexity**: The space used by the `anagrams` dictionary is `O(n)`, as in the worst case, no strings are anagrams, and we store each string individually. Therefore, the space complexity is `O(n)`.

### Real-World Applications
Grouping anagrams can be a useful technique in various applications such as creating crossword puzzles, information retrieval, or anagram-based games. It's also a demonstration of the use of hash maps and sorting in organizing and categorizing data which is an everyday requirement in software development.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks
- Not sorting characters correctly could lead to incorrect keys for anagrams resulting in incorrect groupings.
- Misunderstanding the definition of anagrams could cause issues, for example by considering case-insensitive anagrams erroneously.
- Ignoring the return typeâ€”returning a dictionary instead of a list of values can lead to errors, as LeetCode expects a list of lists.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem is an example of using hash maps to group identical items based on a specific key. Recognizing that anagrams can be represented by a common key (sorted string or character count) is crucial in identifying the grouping strategy.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems
Other problems that apply similar concepts include:

1. LeetCode 242 ""Valid Anagram"" â€” directly checks if two strings are anagrams.
2. LeetCode 438 ""Find All Anagrams in a String"" â€” looks for all anagram substrings within a larger string.
3. LeetCode 3 ""Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters"" â€” although not dealing with anagrams, the use of hash maps to track character occurrences is related.
4. LeetCode 347 ""Top K Frequent Elements"" â€” uses hash maps to group items by frequency.

Applying the grouping strategy with hash maps in these problems can often lead to an efficient solution.

In considering the problem at hand, knowing the constraints, a variety of methods to handle the grouping, the trade-offs of each method, and the detailed implementation provides a comprehensive understanding of how to solve such problems in Python."
50,"LeetCode Problem 50 is ""Pow(x, n)"", which asks you to implement `pow(x, n)`, which calculates `x` raised to the power `n` (i.e. \(x^n\)). Here is the full problem statement:

Implement `pow(x, n)`, which calculates `x` raised to the power `n` (\(x^n\)).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
Output: 1024.00000
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3
Output: 9.26100
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2^-2 = 1/2^2 = 1/4 = 0.25
```

**Constraints:**

- `-100.0 < x < 100.0`
- `-2^31 <= n <= 2^31-1`
- `-10^4 <= x^n <= 10^4`

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

This problem is essentially to calculate the power function without using the in-built power function in Python or any other language, for that matter. Here are the main components of the problem:

1. The base `x` is a floating-point number, and `n` is an integer.
2. The value of `n` can be negative, which implies that the result should be 1 divided by the power of `x` when `n` is positive.
3. The problem explicitly mentions not to use library functions like `pow()` or `**`, so the solution must be designed using other means.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, we need to consider efficiency because the naÃ¯ve approach of simply multiplying `x` by itself `n` times would not be acceptable for large values of `n`.

A popular and efficient method to tackle this problem is to use 'Exponentiation by squaring,' which is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. This technique reduces the number of multiplications needed to calculate power, as follows:

- If `n` is even, you can calculate \(x^{n/2}\) and then square the result.
- If `n` is odd, you can calculate \(x^{(n-1)/2}\) and then square the result and multiply by `x`.

It's important to also handle the case when `n` is negative. If `n` is negative, you can apply the same logic as above, but at the end, you take the reciprocal of the result (since \(x^{-n} = 1/x^n\)).

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's write the Python code that implements the described approach.

```python
def myPow(x, n):
    if n < 0:
        x = 1 / x
        n = -n
        
    def power(x, n):
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        half = power(x, n // 2)
        if n % 2 == 0:
            return half * half
        else:
            return half * half * x

    return power(x, n)
```

Explanations of the code are as follows:

- In the `myPow` function, we first check if `n` is negative. If it is, we invert `x` by taking `1/x` and negate `n` to work with positive exponent only.
- We define a helper function `power(x, n)` that implements the logic for positive `n`.
  - If `n` is zero, we return 1 because any number to the power of 0 is 1.
  - We calculate the power for `n // 2` (integer division by 2) recursively. This halves the exponent in each recursive call and squares the result, utilizing the divide-and-conquer approach.
  - If `n` is even, we simply return `half * half`.
  - If `n` is odd, we have to multiply an additional `x` because we took out one `x` when we reduced the problem size (n was reduced by 1 before halving).
  
- Finally, the `myPow` function returns the result of the `power(x, n)` call.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is \(O(\log n)\) due to the divide and conquer algorithm. Each time we halve the exponent, reducing the number of multiplications needed.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(\log n)\) as well, which is due to the recursion stack. Each recursive call adds a level to the stack.

### Real-World Applications:

This type of problem solving is particularly useful in cryptography, where exponentiation with large numbers is a core operation, as well as in various scientific computing problems that require efficient and accurate computations involving powers.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Handling the case where `n` is negative is crucial, as forgetting it can lead to incorrect results.
- A direct iterative approach might seem simpler but is less efficientâ€”abandoning it for a more complex but significantly more efficient approach is often necessary.
- In the real world, dealing with floating-point numbers would require careful considerations regarding precision and rounding errors, which are beyond this problem's scope.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem is a typical example of the divide-and-conquer strategy, where a large problem is broken down into smaller subproblems, which are solved individually, with their solutions then being combined to solve the larger original problem.

51,"LeetCode Problem 51 corresponds to the ""N-Queens"" problem. Here is an extensive breakdown and solution for this well-known backtracking challenge.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
The N-Queens puzzle is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics. The challenge is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, there can be no two queens sharing the same row, column, or diagonal.

Subtleties of the problem statement include:
- The size of the board (N) is a parameter that can vary, and the solution should work for any positive integer value of N.
- The expected output is a list of solutions, with each solution representing one distinct configuration of the N queens on the board.
- Each solution within the list is represented as a list of strings, where each string represents a row of the chessboard.
   - If there's a queen on the row, the corresponding character in the string is 'Q'.
   - If the row is empty at that column, the corresponding character is '.' (a dot).

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
A popular approach to solving the N-Queens puzzle is backtracking. The backtracking algorithm explores all possible board configurations and ""backtracks"" when it identifies that a configuration cannot possibly lead to a successful solution.

Here are the key steps in solving N-Queens with the backtracking approach:

1. **Initialization**: Start with an empty board, represented by a matrix or a list of strings where each element is a row initialized with dots.

2. **Recursive Exploration**: Place a queen on the board, then proceed to the next row.

3. **Constraints Check**: After placing each queen, check for collisions with other queens on the board. This includes checks for the same row, column, and both diagonals.

4. **Backtracking**: If placing a queen leads to a conflict, backtrack by removing the queen and trying the next position in the row.

5. **Solution Accumulation**: Once a valid configuration for all N queens is found, store the board configuration as a solution.

6. **Resume Exploration**: After finding a valid configuration (or when backtracking), continue exploring for other possible solutions.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
Here is a Python function that implements the backtracking approach:

```python
def solveNQueens(n):
    def create_board(state):
        board = []
        for row in state:
            board.append(''.join(row))
        return board
    
    def is_valid(state, row, col):
        for i in range(row):
            if state[i][col] == 'Q':
                return False
            if (0 <= col - (row - i) < n) and state[i][col - (row - i)] == 'Q':
                return False
            if (0 <= col + (row - i) < n) and state[i][col + (row - i)] == 'Q':
                return False
        return True
    
    def backtrack(state, row):
        if row == n:
            solutions.append(create_board(state))
            return
        for col in range(n):
            if is_valid(state, row, col):
                state[row][col] = 'Q'
                backtrack(state, row + 1)
                state[row][col] = '.'
    
    solutions = []
    empty_row = ['.'] * n
    state = [empty_row[:] for _ in range(n)]
    backtrack(state, 0)
    return solutions
```

- `solveNQueens(n)`: Starts the process by creating an initial board and calling the `backtrack` function.
- `create_board(state)`: Converts the internal state representation (a list of lists) into the required output format (a list of strings).

- `is_valid(state, row, col)`: Checks if placing a queen at the given `row` and `col` is valid. This function checks for conflicts vertically in the same column and diagonally in both directions.

- `backtrack(state, row)`: The recursive backtracking function that attempts to place a queen in each column of the current row, then calls itself to proceed to the next row. If the board state results in a valid configuration where all `N` queens are placed without conflicts, it adds the board to `solutions`.

- `state`: Keeps track of the current board configuration using a 2D array of strings, with each element being either a `'Q'` for a queen or `'.'` for an empty square.

- `solutions`: Accumulates all valid board configurations.

### Elaborate Examples
Let's walk through an example for `n = 4`. When `solveNQueens(4)` is called, we explore placing queens row by row:

1. Place the first queen at `(0, 0)`.
2. Move to the next row and try placing the second queen. The first valid position is `(1, 2)`.
3. Move to the third row. There's no valid column in this row where a queen can be placed without being attacked, so we backtrack.
4. Move the queen in the second row to the next valid position `(1, 3)`.
5. Continue this process to try all other positions. And when we reach `row == n`, we have a solution.

Finally, we would get two solutions:

```
[
 ["".Q.."",
  ""...Q"",
  ""Q..."",
  ""..Q.""],

 [""..Q."",
  ""Q..."",
  ""...Q"",
  "".Q..""]
]
```

### Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this solution is `O(N!)` since there are N possible ways to place the first queen, N-1 to place the second, and so on. The recursive calls generate a tree of calls, each decreasing the number of calls by one possible placement, leading to factorial time complexity.

The space complexity is `O(N)` due to the board state and the recursion stack, which at most will contain N calls deep due to the placement of one queen per row.

### Real-World Applications
- The N-Queens problem is a foundation for understanding constraints satisfaction problems which are prevalent in scheduling, assignment, and planning tasks.
- It's used in algorithm courses to teach recursion, backtracking, and problem-solving heuristics.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks
- Forgetting to create additional board configurations for the solutions (deep copies) may result in all collected solutions being references to the same board.
- A subtle error can be made if diagonals are not checked properly. Remember that there are two diagonals to consider from any given cell.
- One optimization trick is to use additional data structures to track which columns, diagonals, and anti-diagonals are under attack, which can reduce the constant time overhead of the `is_valid` checks.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem is a fundamental example of a backtracking algorithm, wherein you incrementally build up candidates to the solution and abandon a candidate as soon as it determines that this candidate cannot possibly lead to a final solution.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems
There are several LeetCode problems that employ backtracking algorithms:

- LeetCode Problem 52: ""N-Queens II"" - Count the number of distinct solutions to the N-Queens puzzle.
- LeetCode Problem 37: ""Sudoku Solver"" - Solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.
- LeetCode Problem 46: ""Permutations"" - Given a collection of distinct integers, return all possible permutations.
- LeetCode Problem 77: ""Combinations"" - Return all possible combinations of k numbers out of the range [1, n].

Each of these problems builds on skills learned in N-Queens, using backtracking to explore all possible configurations within given constraints."
52,"LeetCode Problem 52 is titled ""N-Queens II"". It's a follow-up to the classic N-Queens problem (Problem 51). The goal of the N-Queens problems is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, there must be no two queens that share the same row, column, or diagonal.

### Problem Statement

The N-Queens II problem asks for the number of distinct solutions to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard without any queens attacking each other. Unlike N-Queens I, which requires all the board configurations as the output, N-Queens II only asks for the total count of such configurations.

Here's some additional context about the problem:

- The input is an integer `n`, which represents both the number of queens and the size of the chessboard (nÃ—n).

- The output is an integer representing the number of distinct solutions.

- You are guaranteed that the answer will always fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

### Solution Rationale

The N-Queens problem is a classic problem for backtracking algorithms, which are a form of recursive algorithm used to solve constraint satisfaction problems. Here's the high-level idea of how a backtracking algorithm might solve N-Queens II:

1. Start from the leftmost column of the board.
2. If all queens are placed, then a solution has been found.
3. Try all rows in the current column. Do the following for every tried row:
   - If the queen can be placed safely in this row, mark this cell and recursively check if placing a queen here leads to a solution.
   - If placing the queen in the current row and proceeding to place further queens leads to a solution, return true.
   - If placing the queen doesn't lead to a solution, unmark this cell (backtrack) and go to step 3 to try other rows.
4. If all rows have been tried and nothing worked, return false to trigger backtracking.

In the case of N-Queens II, since we're only interested in the count of distinct solutions rather than the solutions themselves, we can modify the algorithm to increment a counter every time all queens are placed successfully.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's write Python code for the backtracking algorithm and explain it line by line:

```python
def totalNQueens(n):
    def can_place(row, col):
        for prev_row in range(row):
            if board[prev_row] == col or \
               prev_row - board[prev_row] == row - col or \
               prev_row + board[prev_row] == row + col:
                return False
        return True

    def backtrack(row):
        nonlocal count
        for col in range(n):
            if can_place(row, col):
                board[row] = col
                if row == n - 1:
                    count += 1
                else:
                    backtrack(row + 1)

    count = 0
    board = [-1] * n
    backtrack(0)
    return count
```

- `totalNQueens(n)`: This is the main function that takes an integer `n` and initializes the backtracking algorithm.

- `can_place(row, col)`: A helper function to check whether it is safe to place a queen at the given `row` and `col`. It checks whether any previous row has a queen in the same column or on the same diagonal.

- The two diagonal checks are done by checking if the difference or sum of the row numbers and column numbers are equal, as queens on the same diagonal will have equal row-col difference or row+col sum.

- `backtrack(row)`: A recursive function to try placing a queen on every row. It calls the `can_place` function for each column in the current row. If the queen can be placed safely, it sets the corresponding entry in the `board` array, indicating the queen's column, then moves on to place the next queen by a recursive call to `backtrack(row + 1)`.

- If a solution is found (a queen is placed on the last row), the `count` variable is incremented.

- The `count` variable is defined as nonlocal in order to modify it within the nested `backtrack` function.

- The `backtrack(0)` call starts the backtracking process from the first row.

- Finally, `return count` returns the total number of distinct solutions.

### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N!), where N is the number of queens and the size of the board. Although the backtracking algorithm significantly reduces the search space by pruning the tree, in the worst case (especially with larger values of N), it might still need to explore almost every configuration.

The space complexity is O(N) due to the board and the system's call stack used for recursion.

### Real-World Applications

The N-Queens problem, especially in its algorithmic approach, is an example of how computational thinking can be applied to solve problems that seem purely theoretical. It has real-world applications in scheduling, constraint optimization, and planning systems where the goal is to find solutions that satisfy a set of constraints.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

A common pitfall is not considering both diagonals properly in the `can_place` function. It's crucial to check both the primary and secondary diagonals when determining if a position is under attack.

Another tip is to utilize bitwise operations for further optimization, representing the columns and diagonals as bits. This is an advanced technique and can significantly improve the performance for larger boards.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The N-Queens problem is an example of a backtracking problem, a pattern where an exhaustive search is necessary but can be optimized by eliminating paths that lead to violation of constraints.

53,"LeetCode Problem #53 is ""Maximum Subarray."" This problem is a classic example of a dynamic programming question, which falls under the category of array and divide-and-conquer algorithm challenges.

### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, the task is to find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return that sum.

A subarray is defined as a sequence of elements from the original array that are unbroken in the array and are contiguous.

### Example

For instance, given the array `[-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`, the contiguous subarray with the largest sum is `[4,-1,2,1]`, which sums up to `6`.

### Problem Breakdown

Here are the key aspects of the problem we need to focus on:

- **Contiguous subarray**: The solution is not just any subset of the array; the elements must be consecutive.
- **At least one number**: This means that the subarray cannot be empty.
- **Largest sum**: We want to maximize the sum of the elements in the subarray.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

Two popular approaches to solve this problem are:

1. **Dynamic Programming (Kadane's Algorithm)**: This is the most efficient way to solve the problem. The idea is to use the original array to store the maximum subarray sum found so far as we iterate over it. For each element, we decide whether it's more beneficial to add it to the current subarray or start a new subarray starting from that element.

2. **Divide and Conquer**: This approach breaks down the array into two halves, finds the maximum subarray sum in each half recursively, and also the maximum sum that crosses the middle of the array, then returns the maximum of those three sums.

Dynamic Programming is preferred over Divide and Conquer due to its better time complexity.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Here's how we might implement Kadane's Algorithm in Python:

```python
def maxSubArray(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    max_sum = nums[0]
    current_sum = nums[0]

    for i in range(1, n):
        # If current_sum is negative, discard it
        current_sum = max(nums[i], current_sum + nums[i])
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)

    return max_sum
```

Let's break this down:

- `max_sum` and `current_sum` are initialized to the first element, as it's the only sum we have when we start.
- We iterate from the second element to the end of the array.
- At each step, we decide whether to add the current element to the `current_sum` or start fresh from the current element. `current_sum` essentially represents the maximum sum of subarray ending at the current index.
- We then update `max_sum` to keep track of the maximum subarray sum found so far.

### Elaborate Examples

- For an array like `[1]`, the answer is simply `1`, as there's only one element.
- For an array like `[-1, -2, -3]`, even though all elements are negative, the answer is `-1`, because we have to pick at least one number (the least negative in this case).
- For an array with both positive and negative numbers like `[-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`, the algorithm efficiently finds `6` from the subarray `[4,-1,2,1]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of Kadane's Algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array because it requires a single pass through the input array.

The space complexity is O(1) because weâ€™re using a fixed amount of extra space (`max_sum` and `current_sum` variables) regardless of the input array size.

### Real-World Applications

This problem is relevant in fields like:

- Financial analysis, where you want to find the best period to invest in a stock.
- Computer networking, for analyzing the period with maximum throughput.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

Common pitfalls include not handling negative numbers correctly or forgetting that the subarray should contain at least one number. A neat trick is to initially set `max_sum` and `current_sum` to the first array element to simplify the logic.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The Maximum Subarray problem is a classic example of dynamic programming that uses the technique of storing intermediate results (in this case, the maximum subarray sum so far) to build the final solution.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems

- #152 Maximum Product Subarray (varies from summation to multiplication, requiring handling of negative numbers differently).
- #918 Maximum Sum Circular Subarray (variation with circular wraparound).

Each problem builds on the core concept of dynamic programming and maximizing/minimizing a contiguous subsequence within an array. The strategies learned here can be adapted and expanded upon for those problems.

Remember to always consider edge cases, such as single-element arrays and arrays with all negative numbers when designing and testing your solutions."
54,"The LeetCode problem with the number 54 is titled ""Spiral Matrix"". The problem's description and requirements are outlined below. Following that, I will delve deeply into every aspect of the problem, including solution strategies, coding techniques in Python, and thorough complexity analysis.

### Problem Description

Given an `m x n` matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

### Example

Consider the following matrix:

```
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]
```

The expected output for the matrix above would be:

```
[1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]
```

We start from the top left corner and proceed rightwards, then downwards on the right edge, then leftwards on the bottom edge, and finally upwards on the left edge. We continue this spiral inward until all elements are visited.

### Constraints

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10`
- `-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100`

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The primary challenge of this problem is to navigate the matrix in a spiral order without repeating any element and without missing any out. This requires careful handling of indices and bounds as we traverse through the layers of the matrix from outer to inner.

We need to account for the following aspects:
- When to turn and change direction (e.g., from going right to going down).
- Ensuring that we do not access elements outside the matrix.
- Dealing with matrices that are not square, that is, whose width and height are not equal.
- Handling cases where the spiral becomes a straight line, for example, when the matrix is 1xN or Mx1.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

A common approach involves iterating over the elements in the matrix in a spiral manner by maintaining four pointers or indices representing the current bounds: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`, which denote the current usable rows and columns. As we iterate, we progressively shrink these bounds to move into the inner layers of the spiral.

We can divide the problem into steps corresponding to each direction we move in: right, down, left, and up. Once a full round across these directions is complete, we need to move inward by adjusting the pointers and repeating the process.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

We'll need a loop that will continue until we've traversed all elements. Inside this loop, we would have four nested loops, each one corresponding to one direction of the spiral movement. Before each inner loop, we need to check if we've already covered all elements to avoid repetitions.

### Elaborate Examples

Letâ€™s consider the implications of having a rectangular matrix as an example:

```
[
 [1, 2, 3, 4],
 [5, 6, 7, 8]
]
```

At first pass: we read 1, 2, 3, 4 in the right; 8 down; and nothing needs to be read left or up since that would repeat the 5. The next inward layer is empty, and the spiral is complete.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this solution would be O(m*n), where m is the number of rows, and n is the number of columns, as we need to visit each element once. The space complexity depends on whether we consider the output array as extra space. If we don't, the space complexity is O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of additional space.

### Real-World Applications

The problem of traversing a 2D array in spiral order can be akin to various real-world scenarios, such as navigating a robotics path, processing images in a spiral pattern, or controlling the read head on a circular data storage device.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Off-by-one errors can easily occur while adjusting the bounds. Careful condition checking is needed to avoid accessing elements outside the bounds.
- Given that the number of rows and columns may not be the same, our loops need to account for the case where we have finished traversing a row or column before completing the entire spiral motion.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The ""Spiral Matrix"" problem is an example of array traversal and simulation. Identifying the direction changes and implementing the correct transitions are the crux of the simulation.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems

Several problems involve unique ways to traverse a 2D array:

- LeetCode Problem 885 ""Spiral Matrix III"" (traversing a grid in spiral order and returning the path)

Now letâ€™s implement a solution in Python."
55,"LeetCode Problem 55 is titled ""Jump Game"". The problem statement is as follows:

Given an array of non-negative integers `nums`, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array. Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to determine if you can reach the last index. A jump can either be to any index within your current index plus your jump length or fewer.

Here is a detailed analysis of the problem and its solution:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
The fundamental concept of this problem involves understanding the array where each element's value represents the maximum number of steps you can jump from that index. The starting point is the first element, and the objective is to make a series of jumps such that you reach or move past the final element of the array.

An important aspect of this problem is that you do not need to land on the last index exactly; reaching or crossing it is sufficient. You cannot jump a distance greater than the value at the current index, and jumping less than or equal to this value is also permissible.

#### Key Points to Consider
- The array contains non-negative integers.
- You can jump a variable number of steps at each position, up to the value at that position.
- If you reach a position with a value of 0, you cannot jump further unless that position is the last index.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
One way to approach this problem is to use a greedy algorithm. The greedy approach involves iterating over each element of the array once and tracking the furthest position reachable at each step. By the end of the iteration, if the furthest reachable position is greater than or equal to the last index, the answer is true; otherwise, it is false.

#### Greedy Approach
The intuition behind the greedy approach is that it always tries to take the longest possible jump at each step, which increases the chances of reaching the end.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
Here is the Python code for the greedy approach along with an explanation:
```python
def canJump(nums):
    max_reachable = 0
    target_index = len(nums) - 1

    for i, jump_length in enumerate(nums):
        # If the current index is inaccessible, we cannot proceed further.
        if i > max_reachable:
            return False
        
        # Calculate the furthest position reachable from this index.
        max_reachable = max(max_reachable, i + jump_length)
        
        # If we can reach or pass the target (last index), return True.
        if max_reachable >= target_index:
            return True

    return max_reachable >= target_index
```

- `max_reachable` keeps track of the maximum index we can reach as we iterate through the array.
- `target_index` is the index we're trying to reach (this is the last index of the array).
- We iterate over each index `i` and the corresponding jump length `nums[i]`.
- If at any point `i` is greater than `max_reachable`, it means we've encountered a gap that we cannot jump across, so we return `False`.
- After each step, we update `max_reachable` as the maximum between itself and `i + jump_length`.
- If we reach a point where `max_reachable` is no less than `target_index`, we can reach the end, so we return `True`.
- After the loop, if we've never returned `True`, then `max_reachable < target_index` and we return the result of the comparison.

### Elaborate Examples
Let's look at some examples to understand how the greedy approach works:

- Example 1: `nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]`
  - At start: `max_reachable` is 0 (initially, we can only reach index 0)
  - At index 0: we can reach up to index `0 + 2` (2)
  - At index 1: we can reach up to index `1 + 3` (4), which is already the end
  - We return `True` as we can reach the end

- Example 2: `nums = [3, 2, 1, 0, 4]`
  - At start: `max_reachable` is 0
  - At index 0: we can reach up to index `0 + 3` (3)
  - At index 1: we can reach up to index `1 + 2` (3), no improvement
  - At index 2: we can reach up to index `2 + 1` (3), no improvement
  - At index 3: `max_reachable` is 3, and since `i` is 3, we can't go further because `nums[3]` is 0
  - We return `False`, as we can't go beyond index 3

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we are iterating through the array exactly once.

The space complexity of the solution is O(1) as we are only using a constant amount of extra space to store variables like `max_reachable` and `target_index`.

### Real-World Applications
This problem mirrors real-world challenges such as resource allocation or route planning, where the goal is to reach a destination using a series of limited resources, and only local decisions (the size of the next step) can be made at each stage.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks
In implementing this solution, one might make the mistake of not considering the possibility that `max_reachable` may never be updated if the jumps at each index are insufficient. It is crucial to check if the current index has become inaccessible by comparing it with `max_reachable`.

Another subtle trick is realizing that once `max_reachable` is beyond the last index, there's no need to continue iterating.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem can be classified as a greedy algorithm problem. The greedy approach is characterized by making the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding the global optimum.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems
Some related LeetCode problems include:
- Problem 45, ""Jump Game II"": Similar to this problem but asks for the minimum number of jumps to reach the end.
- Problem 1345, ""Jump Game IV"": A more complex variant of the Jump Game series.
- Problem 1306, ""Jump Game III"": This variant involves jumps that can go either left or right.

Understanding the greedy nature of Problem 55 and the role of local decisions in finding a solution can aid in tackling these related problems."
56,"LeetCode Problem 56 refers to ""Merge Intervals"", which is a classic problem in the interval category. Below is a comprehensive analysis and explanation of this problem:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

In the ""Merge Intervals"" problem, you are given an array of intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represent the start and the end of the ith interval. The intervals may or may not be sorted. The task is to merge all overlapping intervals and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

Two intervals `a` and `b` are considered overlapping if there is at least one common point between them - more formally, if `a.start <= b.end` and `a.end >= b.start`.

#### Subtle Nuances:
- Overlapping is not just limited to fully engulfing an interval; partial overlaps are also valid.
- The problem does not specify whether the intervals are sorted. Sorting the intervals might be necessary to efficiently merge intervals.
- The original order of the intervals after merging does not need to be preserved.
- The definition of ""merge"" in this context means to take two or more overlapping intervals and combine them into a single interval that has the lowest start point and the highest end point of the overlapping intervals.
- If an interval does not overlap with any other, it should appear in the output as is.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve the ""Merge Intervals"" problem, there are several approaches, but one effective solution goes through the following steps:

1. **Sort the Intervals**: Begin by sorting the intervals based on their starting points. This helps you process the intervals in a sequence ensuring that once you've passed an interval, you don't need to consider it again for merging.

2. **Merge Overlapping Intervals**: Iterate through the sorted intervals and for each one, check if it overlaps with the previous one. If it does, merge them by updating the end point of the previous interval with the maximum of its own end and the current interval's end. If it does not overlap, it means that we've reached the end of a sequence of overlapping intervals, and we can safely add the previous interval to our output list and continue with the current interval.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's break down the solution in a step-by-step manner:

```python
def merge(intervals):
    if not intervals:
        return []
    
    # Step 1: Sort by the start of each interval
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    merged = []
    for interval in intervals:
        # If the list of merged intervals is empty or if the current
        # interval does not overlap with the previous, simply append it.
        if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            # Otherwise, there is an overlap, so we merge the current and previous intervals.
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])
    
    return merged
```

- The function `merge` takes a list of intervals as its argument.
- We immediately handle the edge case where the intervals list is empty; this avoids unnecessary computation and immediately returns an empty list.
- We sort the intervals based on their start times (`intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])`). The lambda function is used to extract the start time of each interval, used as a sort key.
- We create an empty list called `merged` which will store our merged intervals.
- We iterate over each interval, checking if `merged` is empty or if the non-overlapping condition holds (`merged[-1][1] < interval[0]`), in which case we append the interval to `merged`.
- If an overlap is detected (the else block), we merge the intervals by updating the end of the last interval in `merged` to be the max of its own end and the current interval's end.

### Elaborate Examples

- **Case 1**: Input `[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
    - After sorting: `[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
    - Iteration 1: `[1,3]` is inserted into `merged`.
    - Iteration 2: `[1,3]` overlaps with `[2,6]`; merge to `[1,6]`.
    - Iteration 3: `[1,6]` does not overlap with `[8,10]`; insert `[8,10]`.
    - Iteration 4: `[8,10]` does not overlap with `[15,18]`; insert `[15,18]`.
    - Output: `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`.

- **Case 2**: Input `[[1,4],[4,5]]`
    - After sorting: `[[1,4],[4,5]]`
    - Iteration 1: `[1,4]` is inserted into `merged`.
    - Iteration 2: `[1,4]` overlaps with `[4,5]` at the boundary; merge to `[1,5]`.
    - Output: `[[1,5]]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where `n` is the number of intervals. The sort operation dominates the time complexity. The merging process itself is linear, as each interval is visited only once. Therefore, the total running time is determined by the sort operation. The space complexity is O(n), assuming the output list `merged` is not counted as extra space (since the problem specification might imply an in-place merge; otherwise, the space complexity would be O(1)).

### Real-World Applications

""Merging Intervals"" is a problem that can appear in various real-world scenarios, such as:

- Merging timeslots in calendar applications to find available meeting times.
- Simplifying genomic intervals in bioinformatics to find overlapping regions of interest.
- Merging ranges of IP addresses in networking for firewall rules optimization.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

One common pitfall is not checking for overlaps correctly, especially when the current interval's start is the same as the previous interval's end. Remember that these are considered overlapping.

A common trick is to sort the intervals first, which simplifies the logic needed to merge intervals, as you don't have to look backward beyond the last interval you've added to your merged list.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem fits the pattern of interval problems which often involve sorting by one endpoint, then iterating and merging or inserting based on the end points. Recognizing these patterns helps in solving similar problems such as ""Insert Interval"" and ""Non-overlapping Intervals.""

57,"LeetCode problem number 57 is titled ""Insert Interval"". This problem falls within the category of array manipulation, specifically dealing with intervals. Let me provide an extensive breakdown of the problem, including an in-depth solution rationale, code explanation, examples, complexity analysis, real-world applications, and links to similar problems.

## Problem Breakdown

Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, which are sorted by their start times, and a new interval, your task is to insert the new interval into the set of existing intervals. After the insertion, you have to make sure that the set still comprises non-overlapping intervals. If there are intervals that now overlap due to the insertion, these intervals must be merged.

Here are the fine details the problem statement includes:

- Intervals are represented as a list of lists of integers, where each list contains two numbers that denote the start and end of an interval.
- The intervals are initially sorted by their start times, which means you don't need to sort them before inserting.
- If an interval to be inserted causes overlaps, you need to merge all intervals that overlap with it into a single interval.
- The interval to be merged should have its start time as the smallest start time among all intervals that are being merged and the end time as the largest end time.
- The result should still be sorted by start times.
- The problem guarantees that the intervals' start and end times are all positive integers.

## In-Depth Solution Rationale

### Approach: One-pass

The one-pass algorithm works as follows:

1. Add all intervals starting before the new interval to the output.
2. Merge intervals that overlap with the new interval.
   - To merge, we compare the end of the new interval to the start of the current interval.
   - If they overlap (i.e., the start of the current interval is less than or equal to the end of the new interval), we merge them by updating the end of the new interval to the maximum of both ends.
3. Add the merged interval (the new interval itself, which might have been updated several times in step 2) to the output.
4. Finally, add all the remaining intervals to the output.

This approach leverages the fact that intervals are already sorted and ensures that each interval is processed only once.

### Python Code Explanation

In Python, this algorithm can be implemented using a list to store the output intervals and iterating over the input intervals to either add them to the output as is or to merge them with the new interval.

### Elaborate Examples

Here, we'll run through a few examples with different scenarios:

1. The new interval does not overlap with any existing interval and lies between two intervals.
2. The new interval overlaps with one or more existing intervals.
3. The new interval lies completely before or after all existing intervals.

### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of intervals. This is because we are going through each interval only once.

The space complexity is also O(N), to store the result which can, in the worst case, contain all the original intervals plus one new interval (when there is no overlap).

### Real-World Applications

Interval problems are common in real-world scenarios such as scheduling (finding free time slots), genomic ranges (locating gene overlaps), or managing reservations in systems like hotel bookings or seat allocations. Understanding how to manipulate intervals is essential in these domains.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

A common pitfall is not considering the case where the new interval overlaps with multiple existing intervals. You should ensure that merging continues until the new interval does not overlap with any other interval.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The problem is an example of interval merging and can be approached effectively by processing elements in a single pass whenever possible, taking advantage of sorted data.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems

- Merge Intervals (LeetCode 56)
- Non-overlapping Intervals (LeetCode 435)

All these problems require handling intervals and overlap in different ways.

Now, let's delve into actual code for a complete understanding. Would you like me to provide a Python implementation of the solution for the ""Insert Interval"" problem?"
58,"LeetCode Problem 58 is ""Length of Last Word"". The problem is as follows:

Given a string s consists of some words separated by spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. If the last word does not exist, return 0.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

For example: 
```
Input: s = ""Hello World""
Output: 5
```
In this example, the last word is ""World"" and its length is 5.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
This problem requires you to process a string to find the last word and then return the length of this word. There are multiple ways to approach this problem, but they all generally involve these steps:
1. Identifying words in the string (usually by spaces).
2. Traversing the string to find the last word.
3. Measuring the length of the last word.
4. Handling edge cases appropriately.

Edge cases can include:
- Strings with trailing spaces.
- A string that is a single word without any spaces.
- The string being empty or consisting only of spaces, in which case the answer should be 0.
- Strings that contain various types of whitespace characters.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
To solve this problem, one strategy is to work backward from the end of the string because weâ€™re only interested in the last word. Working backward would allow us to bypass leading or trailing spaces more efficiently.

A step-by-step approach could be:
1. Start from the end of the string and move backwards to skip any potential trailing spaces.
2. Then continue moving backwards to determine the length of the last word until you reach the beginning of the string or another space.

A more naÃ¯ve approach would involve splitting the string into an array of words and then simply taking the length of the last element in the array. However, this approach can be less efficient because it involves processing the entire string even if we only need the last word.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
Hereâ€™s how you might implement the more efficient approach in Python:

```python
def lengthOfLastWord(s: str) -> int:
    length = 0
    in_word = False
    
    # Start from the end of the string
    for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] != ' ':
            # We found a non-space character
            in_word = True
            length += 1
        elif in_word:
            # We've hit a space after finding a word
            break
                
    return length
```

Letâ€™s break down the code:
- We initialize `length` to 0, which will hold the length of the last word.
- We also initialize a boolean flag `in_word` to False. This flag will help us know if we have encountered a word.
- We iterate over the string in reverse using a for loop with a range that starts from the last index (`len(s) - 1`) and goes to 0 (inclusive of the first index).
- Inside the loop, we check if the current character is a space or not:
    - If it isn't a space (`s[i] != ' '`), weâ€™re either in the middle of the last word or at its start, so we set `in_word` to True and increment `length`.
    - If it is a space and `in_word` is True, this means we have finished traversing through the last word, so we break the loop.
- Finally, we return the `length` we have calculated.

In this code, as soon as we have finished finding the length of the last word, we break from the loop to avoid unnecessary iterations, making it efficient.

### Elaborate Examples
Let's consider few cases with their expected outputs.

Case 1: Normal Case
```
Input: s = ""Hello World""
Output: 5
```
""World"" is the last word, and the length is 5.

Case 2: Trailing Spaces
```
Input: s = ""   fly me   to   the moon  ""
Output: 4
```
The last word is ""moon"", and the length is 4, despite the trailing spaces.

Case 3: Single Word
```
Input: s = ""luffy""
Output: 5
```
There is only one word ""luffy"", and the length is 5.

Case 4: Empty or Spaces Only
```
Input: s = "" ""
Output: 0
```
There is no word here, so the output is 0.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. In the worst case, we traverse the entire string from the end to the beginning. Due to the early break, if the last word is found before the start of the string, it is possible that we don't traverse the entire string, which makes the algorithm more efficient on average, but the upper bound remains O(n) for complexity analysis.

The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a fixed amount of additional space: the `length` integer and the `in_word` boolean, regardless of the input size.

### Real-World Applications
This type of string manipulation could be useful in text processing applications, like word processors, where you often need to find information about specific parts of the text, such as the last word or sentence.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks
Common pitfalls might include:
- Forgetting to handle trailing spaces leading to incorrect word lengths.
- Iterating from the start of the string could lead to inefficiency.
- Confusing characters that are not spaces (e.g., newline, tab) with actual space characters.

To avoid these pitfalls:
- Handle trailing spaces before processing the last word.
- Iterate from the end if only the last element is needed.
- Ensure that only space characters are considered as word delimiters unless specified otherwise.

### Problem Pattern Identification
The problem is an example of a string traversal pattern where we're interested in a specific segment of the string (in this case the last word). It showcases the usefulness of iterating from the end of the string when the problem calls for it.

59,"LeetCode Problem 59 is titled ""Spiral Matrix II"". Below, I will provide an extensive analysis and solution strategy for the problem:

### Problem Statement:
The problem asks you to generate a square matrix of integers filled with numbers from `1` to `n^2` in spiral order. Spiral order means that the first row will be filled with the numbers from `1` to `n`, then continuing down the last column, then back to the first column but from the bottom up, and so on, with the numbers following a clockwise spiral toward the center of the matrix.

### Input:
- An integer `n`, representing the size of the matrix (the matrix will be `n x n`).

### Output:
- An `n x n` matrix filled with the integers from `1` to `n^2` in spiral order.

### Examples:

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 3
Output: [
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 8, 9, 4 ],
 [ 7, 6, 5 ]
]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: [[1]]
```

### Solution Strategy:
The problem can be solved by simulating the spiral movement and filling in the numbers accordingly. We incrementally build the matrix one number at a time, changing direction (right, down, left, and up) at the appropriate boundaries (edges of the matrix and previously filled cells).

Here are the steps:
1. Initialize a matrix `result` with `n` rows and `n` columns, all filled with zeros (to represent an empty matrix).
2. Define variables for the current row (`row`) and column (`col`), and initialize them to `0`.
3. Define variables for the current direction we are moving in, and initialize the direction to 'right'.
4. Keep a count of the next number to be filled in the matrix (`num`), starting from `1`.
5. Loop through the matrix, filling in the numbers while incrementing `num` each time, until `num` reaches `n^2 + 1`.
6. Change directions depending on the boundaries reached (either the edge of the matrix or a cell that is already filled).

### Python Code Explanation:
Let's write the code for this problem in Python, explaining each part of the code in detail:

```python
def generateMatrix(n):
    # Define the final matrix filled with zeros initially.
    result = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Define the direction vectors for right, down, left and up movements.
    dirs = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    cur_dir = 0  # Index for direction
    cur_num = 1  # Start filling with the number 1
    row = 0
    col = 0
    
    while cur_num <= n*n:
        # Fill the current cell with the current number.
        result[row][col] = cur_num
        cur_num += 1
        
        # Calculate the next cell position based on the current direction.
        next_row = row + dirs[cur_dir][0]
        next_col = col + dirs[cur_dir][1]
        
        # Check if the next cell is within the boundaries and is unfilled (still 0).
        if (0 <= next_row < n) and (0 <= next_col < n) and (result[next_row][next_col] == 0):
            row, col = next_row, next_col
        else:
            # Change direction (right -> down -> left -> up -> right -> ...)
            cur_dir = (cur_dir + 1) % 4
            row += dirs[cur_dir][0]
            col += dirs[cur_dir][1]
    
    return result
```

In this code:

- The `result` matrix is initialized to be a 2D list filled with `0`.
- `dirs` is a list that contains directions represented as row and column increments for each of the four possible directions in a spiral movement.
- We use `cur_dir` to keep track of the current direction index in the `dirs` list.
- `row` and `col` track the current position in the matrix.
- The `while` loop runs until we place the final number `n*n` in the matrix.
- Inside the loop, we place the `cur_num` in the current position and calculate the next cell in the current direction.
- If the calculated position is valid (within the matrix boundaries and the cell is empty), we update `row` and `col` to the new position.
- Otherwise, we update `cur_dir` to the next direction and immediately fill the appropriate cell with the next number.

### Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: The time complexity is O(n^2), as we need to fill `n^2` elements in the matrix.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(n^2), due to the space taken up by the output matrix.

### Edge Cases:
- The trivial case where `n = 1` should still return a matrix consisting of a single element `[1]`.
- Large values of `n` should be tested to ensure the algorithm performs within time constraints.

### Real-World Applications:
- This problem is a great representation of many real-world scenarios that involve traversing or filling data in a specific pattern, such as the printing process for certain types of printers.
- Similarly, robotics path planning can use such an algorithm for coverage problems where an area needs to be covered or scanned in a similar efficient manner.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- One common mistake is not handling the change in direction correctly or missing to check if the next cell is already filled.
- A trick to simplify direction changes is to keep them in an array and cycle through them, as done above with `dirs`.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
- This problem follows the simulation pattern where we need to simulate the process of filling the matrix following the rules of a spiral motion. Recognizing this pattern helps in solving similar problems that require a step-by-step simulation of movements or actions.

### Similar Problems:
- LeetCode Problem 54 ""Spiral Matrix"" - instead of generating a matrix, it asks to read a matrix in a spiral order.

60,"LeetCode problem number 60 corresponds to the ""Permutation Sequence"" problem. Here is an extensive breakdown of the problem, along with in-depth solution strategies, code explanations, examples, complexity analysis, real-world applications, common pitfalls and tricks, and related problems.

**Problem Description:**

The problem ""Permutation Sequence"" asks to find the kth permutation sequence of the first `n` natural numbers, considering that these numbers start from 1 to `n`. We have to return the kth permutation sequence as a string, not as a list or array of numbers. The given `n` will be between 1 and 9 (inclusive), and `k` will be between 1 and `n!` (inclusive), where `n!` denotes the factorial of `n`.

This means that if `n = 3`, the permutations in order are:

1. ""123""
2. ""132""
3. ""213""
4. ""231""
5. ""312""
6. ""321""

**Extensive Problem Breakdown:**

Before solving, it is crucial to understand how permutations are generated. They follow a lexicographic (dictionary) order if generated using an algorithm like the next permutation (which repeatedly finds the next permutation in lexicographic order). 

The problem can be broken down into finding the kth permutation without generating all of the previous permutations to save on time and space complexity.

We need to recognize that there are (n-1)! permutations that start with a given number. Similarly, there are (n-2)! permutations that follow the selected first number and additional fixed second number, and so on.

**In-Depth Solution Rationale:**

A brute-force solution would generate all possible permutations and then select the kth one. However, this would be very inefficient with a time complexity of O(n! * n), because generating each permutation takes O(n) time.

To find a more efficient solution, we can utilize the properties of permutation. Since we know the count of permutations that share the same starting digit, we can calculate which digit will be at the first position of the kth permutation by dividing `k` by `(n-1)!`. The result of this division will give us the index in the list of available numbers for the first digit. We then decrease `k` by the number of permutations we have skipped and repeat the process to find the next digits.

**Detailed Python Code Explanation:**

Let's create a function that implements this logic.

```python
import math

def getPermutation(n, k):
    # Initialize the numbers and result
    numbers = list(range(1, n + 1))
    result = []
    k -= 1 # Since the list is zero-indexed
    
    while n > 0:
        # Find the index of the current digit
        index, k = divmod(k, math.factorial(n-1))
        result.append(str(numbers[index]))
        # Remove used number
        numbers.pop(index)
        n -= 1

    # Join result and return
    return ''.join(result)
```

The function `getPermutation` starts by initializing a `numbers` list which contains all numbers from 1 to n. The result variable is an empty list that will hold the digits of our resulting permutation in string form.

We then enter a loop that runs until our list `numbers` is empty. In each iteration we calculate the index of the current digit by dividing `k` by `(n-1)!` using `divmod`, which also gives us the new `k` for the next iteration. We append the found digit to `result`, remove it from `numbers`, and decrease `n` by one.

Finally, we join the list `result` into a string and return it.

**Elaborate Examples:**

Consider `n = 4` and `k = 9`, to find the 9th permutation:

- There are `3!` permutations for each starting digit.
- `9 / 3! = 1` R `3`, so the first digit is `2` because index `1` in `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is `2`.
- New k is `3`. Remaining numbers: `[1, 3, 4]`.
- `3 / 2! = 1` R `1`, so the second digit is `3`.
- New k is `1`. Remaining numbers: `[1, 4]`.
- `1 / 1! = 1` R `0`, so the third digit is `4`.
- Remaining number is `1`.

So the 9th permutation is ""2341"".

**Thorough Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity for this solution is O(n^2). This is because, for each of the n digits, we perform an operation that could be O(n) in the worst case due to the `pop` operation on the list `numbers`, which, in the worst case, involves shifting all elements one position.

The space complexity is O(n), as we store the permutation in a list with n elements and another list `numbers` of n elements.

**Real-World Applications:**

This problem can be applied in situations where we need to generate a specific permutation or arrangement without the need for all previous arrangements. It can be useful in cryptography, games, generating test cases, etc.

**Common Pitfalls and Tricks:**

A common pitfall is to attempt to generate all permutations when only one specific permutation is needed, which leads to unnecessary computations and a significant increase in time complexity.

**Problem Pattern Identification:**

This problem falls under the category of mathematical computation and combinatorics, and specifically, it is an application of factorial number system (also known as factoradic) and permutation generation.

Other similar LeetCode problems include:

- Factor Combinations (Problem 254)
- Next Permutation (Problem 31)

61,"LeetCode Problem 61 is titled ""Rotate List."" First, let's break down the problem statement and understand its requirements.

### Problem Statement:
Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by `k` places.

### Inputs and Outputs:
- **Input:**
  - `head`: The first node of a singly linked list.
  - `k`: An integer representing the number of rotations to the right.

- **Output:**
  - Return the head of the rotated linked list.

### Nuances and Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 500]`.
- The values of the nodes in the list are within the range `[-100, 100]`.
- `k` can be any non-negative integer, including 0, and might be larger than the number of nodes in the list.

### Understanding the Problem:
Rotating a linked list by `k` places to the right means that the last `k % n` nodes (where `n` is the length of the linked list) will be moved to the front of the list. If `k` is larger than `n`, the list will effectively be rotated `k % n` times because rotating the list `n` times returns the list to its original position.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
To solve this problem, we would typically follow these steps:

1. First, if the list is empty (head is `None`), we can immediately return `None`.
2. Find the length of the linked list by iterating through it. This is necessary to determine the effective number of rotations needed (`k % n`).
3. If `k` is a multiple of the length of the list (`k % n == 0`), the list remains unchanged after rotation, and we can return the head as is.
4. Otherwise, we connect the tail of the list with the head, making it a circular list.
5. Determine the new tail of the list, which will be at the node `(n - k % n - 1)` from the start, and the new head will be the next node.
6. The next step after finding the new tail is to disconnect the circular list by setting the `next` pointer of the new tail to `None`.

### Python Code Explanation:
The Python code will implement these steps in functions to manipulate the linked list structure. The linked list node class (`ListNode`) would be provided in the problem's description.

### Time and Space Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of the solution will be `O(n)` because we have to traverse the entire list to find its length and then perform another traversal to find the new tail.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity of the solution is `O(1)` as we are not using any additional data structures that grow with the input size.

### Edge Case Examples:
- A list of length 0 (should return `None`).
- A list with `k` equal to the length of the list (should return the original list).
- A list with `k` greater than the length of the list (should rotate the list effectively `k % n` times).

Now, let's proceed with the detailed Python code to solve this problem."
62,"LeetCode Problem 62 is titled ""Unique Paths."" This is a classic problem in dynamic programming and combinatorics, which presents a very common scenario in grid-based path-finding problems. Let's dive deep into the problem statement, analyze it, and explore different ways to solve it.

### Problem Statement:

There is a `m x n` grid with a robot positioned at the top-left corner (the start position is marked as â€˜Startâ€™ in the diagram below). The robot can only move either down or to the right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked as 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

### Visual Representation:

```
+----+----+----+  ...  +----+
|Start|    |    |       |    |
+----+----+----+  ...  +----+
|   |    |    |       |    |
+----+----+----+  ...  +----+
|   |    |    |  ...  |Finish|
+----+----+----+  ...  +----+
```

### Input:

Two integers `m` and `n`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid.

### Output:

The number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.

### Constraints:

- 1 <= `m`, `n` <= 100
- The answer is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 2 * 10^9.

### Solution Rationale:

#### Approach 1: Dynamic Programming

1. **Subproblems Identification:**
   Each cell in the grid represents a subproblem, specifically, ""how many unique paths are there to this cell?""

2. **State Definition:**
   Let `dp[i][j]` be the number of unique paths to cell `(i, j)`.

3. **State Transition:**
   The robot can only move down or right, so `dp[i][j]` can be reached either from `dp[i-1][j]` (above cell) or `dp[i][j-1]` (left cell). Hence, the transition function is:
   ```
   dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
   ```

4. **Base Case:**
   The base case is the starting cell, which has only one unique path to itself. `dp[0][0] = 1`. Additionally, any cell in the first row or first column will only have one unique path since the robot can only move right and down, thus:
   - `dp[0][j] = 1` for all `j`
   - `dp[i][0] = 1` for all `i`

5. **Algorithm Execution:**
   Start filling the dp array row by row, using the transition function until `dp[m-1][n-1]` is reached.

#### Approach 2: Mathematical (Combinatorics)

Realize that each path consists of exactly `m+n-2` moves, out of which `m-1` moves must be down and `n-1` moves must be right. This problem can be translated into a combination problem: choosing `m-1` moves to be down (or equivalently `n-1` moves to be right) out of a total of `m+n-2` moves.

The number of unique paths is given by the binomial coefficient:
```
C(m+n-2, n-1) or C(m+n-2, m-1)
```

#### Approach 3: Space Optimization

When using dynamic programming, recognize that the value of `dp[i][j]` only relies on the previous row and column. Therefore, the space complexity can be reduced by using a single array instead of a matrix.

### Python Code Explanation:

Let's provide a detailed Python solution using dynamic programming:

```python
def uniquePaths(m, n):
    if not m or not n:
        return 0

    # Initialize the first row and first column
    dp = [[1] * n for _ in range(m)]

    # Iterating through the grid starting from the cell (1, 1)
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]

    # The destination cell holds the answer
    return dp[m - 1][n - 1]
```

In this code:
- The `dp` array is initialized with `1`s in all cells, which accounts for the base case for the first row and the first column.
- Two nested loops iterate through the cells of the grid starting from `(1, 1)` as the first cell `(0, 0)` is the starting point with one path and is already initialized.
- Each cell value is updated by adding the number of paths from the cell above and the cell to the left.
- The function returns `dp[m - 1][n - 1]`, which is the bottom-right corner of the grid and contains the total number of unique paths.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n). This is because we have to visit each cell once and perform a constant amount of work for each cell.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the 2D dp array. This can be reduced to O(n) if space optimization (Approach 3) is used.

### Real-World Applications:

This problem, at its core, represents a discrete path-finding problem, which is common in real-world applications such as:
- Routing protocols in networks that may need to find multiple paths between nodes.
- Path-finding algorithms in robotics, where a robot must determine a path in a confined space.
- Project planning and management where different paths represent sequences of tasks.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- Overlooking the base cases.
- Not initializing the first row and column, which can lead to incorrect results.
- Forgetting that the grid indices are 0-based which might lead to index errors.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem is a clear example of dynamic programming with an optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems. Recognizing these patterns can help solve similar grid-based DP problems.

### Similar Problems:

- LeetCode Problem 63 ""Unique Paths II"" (obstacles on the grid)
- LeetCode Problem 64 ""Minimum Path Sum"" (grid with different path costs)
- LeetCode Problem 120 ""Triangle"" (minimum path sum in a triangle-shaped grid)

### Conclusion:

The ""Unique Paths"" problem teaches fundamental dynamic programming principles, such as defining states, transition functions, and base cases. The different approaches illustrated can carry over to other similar grid-based path problems or combinatorial problems."
63,"LeetCode problem number 63 refers to ""Unique Paths II"". Here is an extensive breakdown of this problem:

### Problem Statement

In ""Unique Paths II"", we are given a 2D grid (represented as a list of lists in Python), which we can interpret as a map or a board. Some of the cells in the grid are obstacles, while others are free to be walked over. The task is to find the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. Here are some key points to note:

- You can only move either down or right at any point in time.
- The grid contains two types of squares: ones representing free space and zeros representing obstacles.
- The top-left cell (`grid[0][0]`) is the starting point, and the bottom-right cell (`grid[m-1][n-1]`) is the destination.
- If the starting or destination cell is an obstacle, the number of unique paths to the destination is zero.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

There are multiple ways to approach this problem. A straightforward method is dynamic programming, which can help us build up the solution based on the number of paths to its subproblems (subgrid cells). Let's discuss potential strategies:

#### Dynamic Programming
The idea is to iterate over the grid and calculate the number of paths to each cell from the top-left corner, iterating row by row or column by column. For each cell:

- If the cell is an obstacle, then the number of paths to that cell is 0 since it can't be reached.
- If the cell is not an obstacle, the number of paths to that cell is the sum of the number of paths to the cell directly above it and the number of paths to the cell to the left (because these are the only two ways we can reach a given cell).

#### Memoization (Top-Down Approach)
Alternatively, we could use a recursive approach with memoization to calculate paths. A top-down dynamic programming solution will start at the destination and recursively calculate the number of paths from each cell to the bottom right by going upwards and leftwards, caching results along the way to avoid redundant calculations.

#### Handling Edges and Obstacles
Special care is needed for the cells in the top row and the leftmost column, as these have only one neighbor each. Also, the presence of obstacles requires an additional check before adding up the counts from neighbor cells.

### Python Code Explanation

Below is an example of a dynamic programming solution for the problem:

```python
def uniquePathsWithObstacles(obstacleGrid):
    if obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1:
        return 0

    m, n = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    dp[0][0] = 1  # start point

    # Fill in the values for the first column
    for i in range(1, m):
        if obstacleGrid[i][0] == 0:
            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0]

    # Fill in the values for the first row
    for j in range(1, n):
        if obstacleGrid[0][j] == 0:
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1]

    # Fill in the rest of the dp table
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]

    return dp[-1][-1]
```

Let's breakdown the above code:

- We first check if the starting point `obstacleGrid[0][0]` is an obstacle, in which case we return 0 as no path can go through an obstacle.
- We initialize the size of the grid `m` and `n` and create a 2D list `dp` with the same dimensions to store the number of paths to each cell.
- We then set the number of paths to the starting point `dp[0][0]` to 1 since there is exactly one way to be at the starting point.
- The loop starting with `for i in range(1, m):` fills in the first column of the `dp` array, using only the value from the cell above, since movement is only either down or right.
- The loop starting with `for j in range(1, n):` does the same for the first row of the `dp` array, using the value from the cell to the left.
- The nested loops towards the end calculate the number of paths for the rest of the cells that are not in the first row or first column.

### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(M*N) since we need to fill in the `dp` array which has `M*N` cells.
- Space Complexity: O(M*N) because we are maintaining a 2D array of the same size as the input grid. This could be reduced to O(N) by only keeping the current and previous rows during the iteration.

### Elaborate Examples

Consider the following grid as an example:

```
[
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 0]
]
```

The function would first initialize the `dp` array as:

```
[
  [1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0]
]
```

After filling the first row and first column according to the rules mentioned above, the `dp` array will be:

```
[
  [1, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 0]
]
```

After processing the rest of the grid, the `dp` array will look like this:

```
[
  [1, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, 1],
  [1, 1, 2]
]
```

So, `dp[-1][-1]`, which is `dp[2][2]`, will be `2`, and that will be the output since there are two unique paths to reach the destination.

### Real-World Applications

The problem of counting unique paths in a grid with obstacles can be considered a simplified version of more complex real-world problems like robot path planning in an environment with obstacles. Finding paths on a grid is fundamental in algorithms for routing, games, network packet delivery, and city planning, among others.

### Links to Similar Problems

This problem is a variant of the classic ""Unique Paths"" problem, which does not include obstacles. Other related problems include:

- LeetCode Problem 62: ""Unique Paths"" (similar problem without obstacles).
- LeetCode Problem 64: ""Minimum Path Sum"" (finding minimum sum instead of counting paths).
- LeetCode Problem 980: ""Unique Paths III"" (paths must visit all non-obstacle cells exactly once).

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

A common mistake is not correctly initializing the `dp` array or not properly handling the cells with obstacles. It's also important to check the starting and ending cell for obstacles, which some might overlook.

Remember to check edge cases, like when the grid is a single row or a single column, or when the grid's cells are all obstacles. These can be the source of bugs if not handled correctly."
64,"LeetCode problem number 64 is titled ""Minimum Path Sum,"" and it falls under the category of dynamic programming problems. Let's break down the problem statement and analyze every aspect of it before discussing solutions.

### Problem Statement:

Given a `m x n` grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from the top left to the bottom right which minimizes the sum of all the numbers along its path.

#### Constraints:

1. You can only move either down or right at any point in time.
2. The number of rows `m` and columns `n` will be in the range [1, 200].
3. Each cell has a non-negative integer value.

### Problem Analysis:

This is a classic dynamic programming (DP) problem where we want to find the minimum cost path in a 2D matrix. The constraints mean that we have limited movement options â€“ we can only move to the right or down, which significantly reduces the number of paths we need to consider.

### Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, we'll use dynamic programming to build up a solution by solving smaller subproblems. We can create a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum path sum to reach the cell at `(i, j)` from the top left corner. The minimum path sum at `dp[i][j]` would then be the minimum of either `dp[i-1][j]` or `dp[i][j-1]` plus the value at grid cell `(i, j)`.

For the boundary cells (first row and first column), we can only move from the left or the top, respectively. Therefore, the DP table is filled straightforwardly for these cells by cumulative sums.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

```python
def minPathSum(grid):
    if not grid:
        return 0
    
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
    
    # Initialize first row
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[0][i] = dp[0][i - 1] + grid[0][i]
    
    # Initialize first column
    for j in range(1, m):
        dp[j][0] = dp[j - 1][0] + grid[j][0]
        
    # Fill out the DP table
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + grid[i][j]
    
    # The bottom-right cell contains the answer
    return dp[-1][-1]
```

Let's break it down:
- We start by handling the edge case where `grid` might be empty.
- Determine the dimensions `m` and `n` of the grid.
- Create a 2D list `dp` of the same dimensions to store the minimum path sums.
- Initialize the top-left value `dp[0][0]` since it's where we start.
- Fill the first row and first column separately as there is only one way to reach those cells.
- For the rest of the cells, calculate the `dp[i][j]` value by taking the minimum of the cell to the left (`dp[i][j-1]`) and the cell above (`dp[i-1][j]`) then adding the grid value `grid[i][j]`.
- After populating the whole DP table, the answer is the value in the bottom-right cell `dp[-1][-1]`.

### Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: We iterate through each cell in the grid exactly once. Thus, the time complexity is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid.
- Space Complexity: We allocate a 2D list of the same size as the grid, which gives us a space complexity of `O(m * n)`.

### Examples:

1. If the grid is:
   ```
   [1,3,1]
   [1,5,1]
   [4,2,1]
   ```
   The minimum path sum is `7` because `1â†’3â†’1â†’1â†’1â†’1` is the path that gives us the minimum sum.

2. If the grid is:
   ```
   [1,2,5]
   [3,2,1]
   ```
   The minimum path sum is `6` because `1â†’2â†’2â†’1` is the path that gives us the minimum sum.

### Real-World Applications:

This problem is applicable in various scenarios where you need to find optimal paths or routes given constraints, such as GPS navigation systems, pathfinding in robotics, and optimizing network traffic routing.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

When solving dynamic programming problems, some common pitfalls include:
- Not initializing the base cases correctly.
- Overlooking the boundary conditions.
- Trying to optimize prematurely, leading to overly complicated code.

For this particular DP problem, it's important to handle the first row and column correctly since they set the stage for calculating the rest of the DP table.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem is a classical example of dynamic programming, where we solve the problem by combining the solutions to subproblems. Recognizing that the problem asks for an optimal substructure and has overlapping subproblems, dynamic programming is an ideal strategy. It follows the pattern that the optimal solution to the entire problem depends on the optimal solutions to its subproblems.

### Related LeetCode Problems:

Several LeetCode problems explore similar patterns of dynamic programming and grid-based optimization, including:
- Problem 62: Unique Paths
- Problem 63: Unique Paths II
- Problem 120: Triangle
- Problem 221: Maximal Square

Each of these problems also requires understanding how to navigate a grid or matrix with certain conditions and use dynamic programming to find an optimal solution."
65,"LeetCode problem number 65 is titled ""Valid Number"" and it is a hard-level problem.

### Problem Statement:

A valid number can be split up into these components (in order):

1. A decimal number or an integer.
2. (Optional) An 'e' or 'E', followed by an integer.

A decimal number can be split up into these components (in order):

1. (Optional) A sign character (either '+' or '-').
2. One of the following formats:
   - One or more digits, followed by a dot '.'.
   - One or more digits, followed by a dot '.', followed by one or more digits.
   - A dot '.', followed by one or more digits.

An integer can be split up into these components (in order):

1. (Optional) A sign character (either '+' or '-').
2. One or more digits.

For example, all the following are valid numbers: [""2"", ""0089"", ""-0.1"", ""+3.14"", ""4."", ""-.9"", ""2e10"", ""-90E3"", ""3e+7"", ""+6e-1"", ""53.5e93"", ""-123.456e789""], while the following are not valid numbers: [""abc"", ""1a"", ""1e"", ""e3"", ""99e2.5"", ""--6"", ""-+3"", ""95a54e53""].

Given a string s, return true if s is a valid number.

### Examples:

Example 1:
```
Input: s = ""0""
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = ""e""
Output: false
```

Example 3:
```
Input: s = "".""
Output: false
```

Example 4:
```
Input: s = "".1""
Output: true
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 20`
- `s` consists of only English letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits (0-9), plus '+', minus '-', or dot '.'.

### Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, we need to define a state machine or use regular expressions that recognize valid number formats.

The algorithm should follow these steps:
1. Strip whitespace from both ends of the string since it should not affect the validity.
2. Check if there is an optional sign ('+' or '-') at the beginning.
3. Check if there is a sequence of digits. This sequence can optionally include a single decimal point (either before, after, or between digits).
4. Check if there is an exponential part, which would start with an 'e' or 'E' followed by an optional sign and a sequence of digits.
5. Validate that after all these checks, there are no other characters left in the string.

Python's `re` module can be used to define a regular expression that encapsulates all these rules and test the input string against it.

### Python Code Explanation:

A Python function using a regular expression can be written as follows:

```python
import re

def isNumber(s: str) -> bool:
    # Define the regular expression pattern for a valid number
    pattern = r'^[+-]?(\d+(\.\d*)?|\.\d+)([eE][+-]?\d+)?$'

    # Compile the pattern
    p = re.compile(pattern)

    # Use the fullmatch method to check if the entire string matches the pattern
    return p.fullmatch(s.strip()) is not None
```

In this code:
- `^[+-]?` matches the start of the string, followed by an optional sign.
- `(\d+(\.\d*)?|\.\d+)` matches a sequence of digits with an optional decimal point, which can be followed by more digits, or a decimal point followed by one or more digits.
- `([eE][+-]?\d+)?$` matches an optional exponential part at the end of the string with an 'e' or 'E', an optional sign, and a sequence of digits.
- `re.fullmatch()` checks if the entire string matches the pattern.
- `s.strip()` is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this approach is O(n) where n is the length of the string, because the regular expression engine will process each character of the string at most a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) since we are using only a constant amount of extra space for the regular expression and the match object.

### Real-World Applications:

Validating numerical inputs is a common requirement in many applications, such as data entry systems, scientific tools, and configuration settings for software. Ensuring that user input adheres to a specific numeric format can prevent errors and inconsistencies in data processing.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Regular expressions can be quite powerful but also complex and difficult to debug. It's important to cover all possible variations of valid and invalid inputs and test them extensively.
- Ensuring that leading and trailing whitespaces do not influence the result is important because some environments or user inputs might introduce unexpected spaces.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

The problem can be categorized as string parsing and validation, which is a common task in both programming contests and real-world applications. Recognizing that this problem requires a solution that can check very specific conditions in a sequence within a string suggests that regular expressions or state machines are viable approaches.

### Links to Similar Problems:

- LeetCode Problem 8: ""String to Integer (atoi)"" which involves parsing a string to convert it to an integer, handling whitespaces, and dealing with potential signs and overflow.
- LeetCode Problem 20: ""Valid Parentheses"", although not about number validation, it deals with validating the sequence and structure within a string.
- LeetCode Problem 680: ""Valid Palindrome II"", where you must determine whether a string can be a palindrome after removing at most one character, also relates to string parsing and validation.

Careful consideration of these related problems can reinforce understanding of parsing different structured data from strings and utilizing state machines or pattern matching techniques to validate formats."
66,"LeetCode Problem 66 is titled ""Plus One."" Given a non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer, this problem asks you to increment the integer by one. The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array stores a single digit. You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
The problem can be broken down into a few small steps:

1. Interpret the array of single-digit numbers as a single integer.
2. Add one to that integer.
3. Convert the resulting integer back into an array of single digits.
4. Handle any carry-over that might occur when adding one to a number that ends with a 9.

The subtle nuances in this problem lie in managing the carry. When a digit is 9, adding one to it will result in 10, meaning the current digit becomes 0, and we have to add a carry to the next significant digit. This carry might propagate to the most significant digit, and in some cases, a new digit has to be added to the array (e.g., when the array is `[9, 9]`, the result is `[1, 0, 0]`).

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
Let's walk through the different approaches:

**Iterative Approach**
- Iterate over the array starting from the least significant digit (the end of the array).
- Add one to the current digit.
- If the result is less than 10, we can simply return the modified array.
- If it is equal to 10, set that digit to 0 and continue the process for the next significant digit.
- If a carry is propagated past the most significant digit, prepend a 1 to the array.

This method is ideal because it directly confronts the problem as one of digit manipulation, exactly how the problem is presented.

**Converting to Integer**
An alternative approach could involve converting the array to an actual integer, adding one, and then converting it back to an array. However, this approach is less efficient because it ignores the efficiency of working within the digit array itself, and for very long numbers, it may lead to issues with integer overflow or precision in some languages.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
Now let's go with the iterative approach described above:

```python
def plusOne(digits):
    n = len(digits)
    
    # Start from the end of the array (least significant digit)
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        # Add one to the current digit
        digits[i] += 1
        
        # If the result is less than 10, no carry over so we return the array
        if digits[i] < 10:
            return digits
        
        # If it is 10, we have a carry over so we set the current digit to 0
        digits[i] = 0
        
    # If we are here, we had a carry from the most significant digit
    # So we need to add a new most significant digit which is 1
    return [1] + digits
```

- `n = len(digits)`: This line finds the total number of digits.
- `for i in range(n-1, -1, -1)`: This is a for loop that iterates backward through the array, from the last element to the first element.
- `digits[i] += 1`: This adds one to the current digit.
- `if digits[i] < 10`: Check if the result of the addition is less than 10. If it is, the function returns the array immediately.
- `digits[i] = 0`: If we have a carry (because the digit was 10), we set the current digit to 0.
- `return [1] + digits`: If we exit the loop and still have a carry, we need to add a new digit at the beginning of the array.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's take a look at a few example cases:

- `digits = [1, 2, 3]` â†’ Here, adding one to the last digit doesn't cause any carry, so the result is `[1, 2, 4]`.
- `digits = [4, 3, 2, 1]` â†’ Again, no carry is needed, so the result is `[4, 3, 2, 2]`.
- `digits = [9]` â†’ This results in a carry that requires a new digit: `[1, 0]`.
- `digits = [9, 9, 9]` â†’ Here, each 9 becomes a 0, and a new 1 is added at the beginning: `[1, 0, 0, 0]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
For this problem, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of digits in the input array because we may potentially have to traverse the entire array.
The space complexity is O(1) since we are modifying the array in place. However, in the worst-case scenario where we need to add a new digit at the beginning, the space complexity would be O(n + 1) = O(n), as we need space for one additional digit.

### Real-World Applications
This problem can be seen as an abstraction of many real-world scenarios where operations or transactions are done at the individual digit level, such as in reversing or increasing serial numbers, counters, or odometers.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks
A common pitfall is forgetting to handle the carry correctly, particularly when the carry affects the most significant digit. A trick to solving digit manipulation problems like these is to work from the least significant digit to the most significant digit.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem fits into the digit manipulation problem pattern, specifically relating to incrementing numerical values.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems
Similar problems include:

- LeetCode 415: Add Strings (String-based numeral addition)
- LeetCode 43: Multiply Strings (String-based numeral multiplication)

Each of these problems involves manipulating numbers at the digit level and could require managing carry-over or size expansion. The skills used in this problem, such as iterating from the least to the most significant digit and managing the carry, will help tackle these related problems."
67,"LeetCode Problem #67 is titled ""Add Binary"" and it is categorized under the string manipulation domain. The problem statement is as follows:

Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return their sum as a binary string.

### Problem Breakdown:

The input of the problem consists of two strings, `a` and `b`, which only contain characters '0' or '1', i.e., they represent numbers in binary format.

The task is to calculate the sum of these binary numbers and return the result also as a binary string.

### Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, we need to implement an algorithm similar to how we manually add binary numbers from right to left, keeping track of the carry.

1. Start from the rightmost bits of both strings and move leftwards.
2. For each pair of bits, add them along with the carry from the previous step (initialize carry to 0).
3. The sum could result in one of the following: 0, 1, or 2 (if there's a carry from the preceding bits).
4. If the sum is 2 or more, set the carry for the next iteration to 1 (because 2 in binary is '10') and adjust the current sum (current bit) accordingly (0 if the sum is 2, 1 if the sum is 3).
5. Append the resulting bit to the result string.
6. After processing both strings, if there's still a carry, append '1' to the result.
7. Since we have built the result string in reverse order, before returning, we need to reverse it to get the correct binary sum.

### Code Explanation:

Here's a Python function that implements the above logic:

```python
def addBinary(a, b):
    result = []
    carry = 0
    i, j = len(a) - 1, len(b) - 1

    while i >= 0 or j >= 0 or carry:
        total = carry
        if i >= 0:
            total += int(a[i])
            i -= 1
        if j >= 0:
            total += int(b[j])
            j -= 1
            
        carry = total // 2
        result.append(str(total % 2))

    return ''.join(reversed(result))
```

Explanation Line by Line:

- `result = []`: Create an empty list to store individual bits of the final binary sum.
- `carry = 0`: Initialize the carry to zero.
- `i, j = len(a) - 1, len(b) - 1`: Set pointers `i` and `j` to point to the last characters in `a` and `b` respectively.
- `while i >= 0 or j >= 0 or carry:`: Continue looping until both `i` and `j` are out of bounds, and there is no carry left.
- Inside the loop:
  - `total = carry`: Initialize the total sum for the current position to the carry from the last position.
  - The `if` blocks calculate and add the current bit of each string to the total sum.
  - `carry = total // 2`: Update the carry for the next iteration.
  - `result.append(str(total % 2))`: Append the current bit to the result list after modding by 2 (to get either 0 or 1).
- Finally, `''.join(reversed(result))` reverses the list and returns it as a string.

### Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the maximum length of `a` or `b`. Each bit is visited once.
- Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the maximum length of the output binary string.

### Elaborate Examples:

1. `a = ""1010""`, `b = ""1011""`
   - Step-by-step addition:
     - Start from the rightmost bits: 0 + 1 = 1 (result `1`, carry `0`)
     - Next bits: 1 + 1 = 2 (result `0`, carry `1`)
     - Next bits: 0 + 0 + carry(1) = 1 (result `1`, carry `0`)
     - Next bits: 1 + 1 = 2 (result `0`, carry `1`)
     - Carry is 1, so the final result is `10101`.
   - Final answer: `""10101""`

2. `a = ""11""`, `b = ""1""`
   - Step-by-step addition:
     - Start from the rightmost bits: 1 + 1 = 2 (result `0`, carry `1`)
     - Next bits: 1 + carry(1) = 2 (result `0`, carry `1`)
     - Carry is 1, so the final result is `100`.
   - Final answer: `""100""`

### Real-World Applications:

The problem of adding binary numbers is fundamental to computer arithmetic and is performed by the arithmetic logic units (ALUs) within CPUs. Understanding such binary operations is essential for low-level programming, firmware development, and hardware design.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Remember to handle the carry correctly at each step.
- Don't forget to reverse the result at the end since you're building it backwards.
- Pay attention to handle cases where one string is longer than the other.
- Be careful to add the remaining carry if any after processing all bits of both strings.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem falls under the pattern of simulating manual arithmetic operations using strings. Recognizing this pattern can help you apply similar strategies to related problems like adding numbers represented as linked lists or strings in different bases.

### Links to Similar Problems:

Here are some related LeetCode problems:

1. ""Add Two Numbers"" (Problem #2) - You add two numbers represented by linked lists and return the sum as a linked list.
2. ""Multiply Strings"" (Problem #43) - You multiply two numbers represented as strings without converting them into integers.
3. ""Plus One"" (Problem #66) - You add one to a number represented in a list as digits.

These problems require similar logic in digit-by-digit manipulation and keeping track of intermediate results, like carries in addition or partial products in multiplication. The skills you learn from solving the ""Add Binary"" problem can be applied to tackle these challenges as well."
68,"LeetCode Problem 68 is titled ""Text Justification."" This problem is about formatting text to given specifications and is therefore a string manipulation challenge. Below, I will break down the problem, discuss solution strategies, provide a detailed Python code explanation, give examples, analyze the time and space complexity, connect the solution to real-world applications, talk about common pitfalls and tricks, identify problem-solving patterns, and list related LeetCode problems.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The Text Justification problem requires us to format a list of words into a specific justification format for text. Here are the specifications given in the problem:

- Words in the text must be fully justified left and right.
- Each line other than the last must have as many words as possible and be spaced out to the width of maxWidth.
- The spaces between the words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If they cannot be evenly distributed, the extra spaces should be placed on the left.
- The last line must be left-justified and should not be spaced out to the maxWidth.
- Each line must be padded with spaces at the end if necessary to ensure it has exactly maxWidth characters.

We are required to return a list of strings representing the formatted text.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
To solve this problem, we typically follow these steps:
1. Greedily pick as many words as can fit in one line with at least one space between them.
2. Justify the words with the appropriate number of spaces:
    - Distribute spaces as evenly as possible when it's not the last line.
    - For the last line, just add a single space between words and add spaces at the end if necessary.
3. Repeat the above steps for all lines.

Let's go through the details of implementing this algorithm:
- Use a helper function to add spaces between words for a line.
- Track the number of characters on the current line and the list of words to include in that line.
- Iterate over the words, deciding which ones fit in the current line, and call the helper function to justify them as needed.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Now, let's write Python code that tackles all of the points above:

```python
def fullJustify(words, maxWidth):
    def justifyLine(line, maxWidth, isLast):
        # If it's the last line or contains only one word, left-justify
        if isLast or len(line) == 1:
            return ' '.join(line).ljust(maxWidth)
        # Calculate number of spaces
        totalSpaces = maxWidth - sum(len(word) for word in line)
        betweenSpaces, extra = divmod(totalSpaces, len(line) - 1)
        # Distribute extra spaces among the first 'extra' spaces
        for i in range(extra):
            line[i] += ' '
        # Join the words with the standard space count in between
        return (' ' * betweenSpaces).join(line)
    
    result, currentLine, numLetters = [], [], 0
    for word in words:
        if numLetters + len(word) + len(currentLine) <= maxWidth:
            currentLine.append(word)
            numLetters += len(word)
        else:
            result.append(justifyLine(currentLine, maxWidth, False))
            currentLine, numLetters = [word], len(word)
    
    # Add the last line and justify it
    result.append(justifyLine(currentLine, maxWidth, True))
    return result
```

Now let's break down this code.

1. `fullJustify` is the main function that takes the `words` list and `maxWidth` as parameters.
2. `justifyLine` is a helper function that justifies a single line. It takes any list of words (`line`), the `maxWidth`, and a boolean `isLast` to indicate if this is the last line.
3. Inside `justifyLine`, we first handle the case where the line is the last line or contains a single word by simply left-justifying it.
4. If it's not the last line, we calculate the `totalSpaces` needed and how to distribute them (`betweenSpaces`, `extra`).

The loop inside the `fullJustify` function is where we build each line, checking if adding a new word exceeds the `maxWidth`. If it does, we justify what we have so far and start a new line (`currentLine`). The number of characters is tracked by `numLetters`.

After iterating through all the words, we add and justify the last line. Finally, we return the list of justified lines (`result`).

### Elaborate Examples:
Let's execute the code with an example:
```python
words = [""This"", ""is"", ""an"", ""example"", ""of"", ""text"", ""justification.""]
maxWidth = 16
```
- The first line can fit the words ""This"", ""is"", and ""an"".
- The second line can fit ""example"", ""of"", ""text"".
- The last line will just have ""justification."".

Let's see the output:

```python
fullJustify(words, maxWidth)
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
Analyzing this implementation, we can derive the time and the space complexity.

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the total number of characters in all words. This is because we process each word once and do constant work per word. The join operation is linear with respect to the number of characters in the line, which is at most maxWidth.
- Space Complexity: O(n), as we create a list of lines and each line can have a length up to maxWidth. However, if we consider the output is required for the problem and cannot be counted towards the space complexity, the auxiliary space usage (space excluding input and output) is O(maxWidth), as we only keep the current line and a few integers for counting.

### Real-World Applications:
The problem of text justification has practical implications in word processing software and web content rendering where the layout of text must be controlled and made readable according to certain design constraints.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- Remember to account for the single space that is required between words when counting the length of a line.
- Ensuring the last line of text is left-justified rather than fully-justified is a common oversight.
- Distributing spaces can be tricky; ensure you handle cases with one word and the last line correctly.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
The problem involves greedy algorithms since we are greedily trying to fit as many words as possible into a line. Also, it's a simulation problem, where we carefully enact the rules provided.

69,"LeetCode Problem 69 is titled ""Sqrt(x)"". This is a classical problem in numerical computing and typically encountered as one of the standard library functions in many programming languages. The problem statement is succinct and requires implementation of the square root function for non-negative integers.

## Problem Statement

Given a non-negative integer `x`, compute and return the integer part of the natural square root of `x`.

That is, compute the largest integer `result` such that `result * result <= x`. The returned integer `result` should not include any fractional digits.

## Example Cases

To better understand the problem, let's consider a few example cases:

1. If `x = 4`, the square root of 4 is 2, so the function should return `2`.
2. If `x = 8`, the natural square root of 8 is approximately 2.82842, but since we want the integer part, the function should return `2`.

## Potential Solution Approaches

There are multiple strategies you could use to solve this problem:

### Binary Search

Given that the square root function is monotonically increasing, we can use binary search to find the floor of the square root. Binary search can narrow down the interval containing the square root by checking the mid-values of interval `[0, x]`.

### Newton's Method

This is a classic numerical method for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. It can be used here to approximate the square root.

### Exponent and Logarithms

Since many programming languages include built-in functions for exponentiation and natural logarithms, you could compute the square root of `x` using `exp(log(x) / 2)`, then take the integer part.

### Brute Force

You could start at 1 and go up to `x`, trying to find the largest number whose square is less than or equal to `x`. However, this method is too slow for large values of `x` and is not efficient.

### Bit Manipulation (for experts)

Bit manipulation techniques can be used to compute square roots by constructing the result bit by bit, starting from the most significant bit. This method requires a strong understanding of binary arithmetic.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's explore the binary search approach since it is both efficient and relatively straightforward to implement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the binary search solution in Python:

```python
def mySqrt(x):
    if x < 2:
        return x

    left, right = 2, x // 2
    
    while left <= right:
        pivot = left + (right - left) // 2
        num = pivot * pivot
        
        if num > x:
            right = pivot - 1
        elif num < x:
            left = pivot + 1
        else:
            return pivot
    
    return right  # right will be the integer part of the sqrt(x)

# You can test the function with an input:
print(mySqrt(8))  # Output: 2
```
The code snippet above is a binary search implementation for finding the integer part of the square root of `x`:

- First, handle the cases where `x` is less than 2 as edge cases.
- Set up the `left` and `right` pointers to limit the search to a reasonable range (`2` to `x // 2`).
- Use a `while` loop to perform binary search within this range.
- Determine the `pivot` point and check if the square of `pivot` (`num`) is greater than, less than, or equal to `x`.
- Adjust the `left` and `right` pointers based on whether `num` is less than or greater than `x`.
- If `num` equals `x`, immediately return `pivot` as the exact sqrt of `x`.
- When the loop exits, `right` is the integer part of the sqrt of `x` since `left` would have surpassed `right`.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this binary search approach is O(log x) because each step of the binary search cuts the range of possible answers in half. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of additional space.

## Real-World Applications

Calculating square roots is a fundamental operation in mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science. It's used in calculations involving areas, forces, probabilities, and many other formulas. Thus, optimally solving this problem is practical and beneficial across a wide array of fields.

## Common Pitfalls and Tips

- Remember to handle edge cases where the input is 0 or 1, as these can be trivially returned.
- The use of integer division (`//`) is crucial to avoid float division errors and to perform correct binary search within integer bounds.
- Ensure to avoid multiplication overflow when computing `num = pivot * pivot` for large values of `pivot`.

## Problem Pattern Identification

This problem exemplifies the binary search pattern on a monotonic function or set. Recognizing when a problem can be solved with binary search is critical for efficiently tackling search problems with large input space.

70,"LeetCode Problem number 70 is titled ""Climbing Stairs"". This classic problem falls under the category of dynamic programming and can also be approached using Fibonacci sequence concepts. Now, let's break down the problem and discuss it in detail, examining various solution strategies and their implementations in Python.

### Problem Statement

You are climbing a staircase. It starts with you at the bottom, and you must reach the top. The staircase has `n` steps, and you can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time. Your task is to determine how many distinct ways you can climb to the top.

#### Inputs and Outputs:

- The input is a single integer `n` representing the total number of steps in the staircase.
- The output is an integer representing the number of distinct ways to climb to the top.

#### Constraints:

- Given `n` will be a positive integer, typically within a range that avoids integer overflow issues.

### Examples:

Example 1:
```
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

Example 2:
```
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

### Solution Strategy

There are various strategies to solve this problem. Let's discuss three common ones:

**1. Recursive (Brute Force):**
A simple way to solve this is using recursion by breaking down the problem into subproblems. For instance, to reach the nth step, you could either come from the (n-1)th step or the (n-2)th step. This suggests a recursive relationship. However, this approach often results in redundant calculations and a very high time complexity (exponential), making it impractical for larger values of `n`.

**2. Dynamic Programming:**
To optimize the recursive solution, we can use dynamic programming (DP). With DP, we store the results of subproblems in a table to avoid redundant calculations. The DP approach here closely resembles the Fibonacci sequence, where `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]` (similar to `fib(i) = fib(i-1) + fib(i-2)`). This approach has a linear time complexity.

**3. Fibonacci Sequence (Space-Optimized Dynamic Programming):**
We can notice that at any step, the number of ways to reach that step is only dependent on the previous two steps. So, instead of storing the entire DP table, we can just store the last two values, further optimizing the space complexity.

### Python Code Explanation

Let's implement the space-optimized dynamic programming approach:

```python
def climbStairs(n):
    a, b = 1, 1
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```

Here's a line-by-line breakdown:

- `a, b = 1, 1`: Initialize two variables `a` and `b` both set to 1. `a` represents the number of ways to reach the current step, `b` represents the number of ways to reach the next step.

- `for i in range(n)`: Iterate `n` times.

- `a, b = b, a + b`: Update `a` to `b`, and `b` to `a + b`. This simulates moving up the staircase, using the Fibonacci-like sequence, where the new `b` is the sum of the ways to reach the current and previous steps.

- `return a`: After iterating `n` times, `a` will contain the number of ways to reach step `n`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: Since we loop through `n` steps once, the time complexity is O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: We use only two variables regardless of `n`, so the space complexity is O(1).

### Real-World Applications

The ""Climbing Stairs"" problem is a simplified model of many real-world scenarios involving permutations and combinations, such as:
- Pathfinding in grids or graphs, where you have limited options at each step.
- Resource allocation with constraints.
- Calculating probabilities in board games or puzzles where moves are limited.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Avoiding recursion for large `n` due to stack overflow and exponential time complexity.
- Recognizing the Fibonacci pattern can greatly simplify the solution.
- Remembering that dynamic programming can often be space-optimized if only a few previous states are necessary.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem is an excellent example of both dynamic programming and recognizing mathematical sequences (Fibonacci sequence) in algorithmic problems. Learning to identify such patterns can significantly reduce the complexity of problem-solving.

71,"LeetCode Problem 71 is titled ""Simplify Path,"" which is a problem in the domain of string manipulation and stack usage. Below, I will provide a comprehensive breakdown of the problem and its solution, including a detailed explanation of the code and complexities.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The problem statement asks you to simplify an absolute path for a Unix-style file system. A Unix file system has a particular way of representing file paths, and your task is to simplify the input path in accordance with specific rules:

1. A period `'.'` refers to the current directory.
2. A double period `'..'` refers to the directory up a level.
3. Multiple consecutive slashes `'//'` are treated as a single slash `'/'`.
4. The path must always begin with a single slash `'/'`, and there must be only a single slash between directory names.
5. The path must not end with a trailing `'/'`, except in the case where the path is just `""/""`, representing the root directory.
6. You must avoid any redundant folders like `'.'` or the result of over-navigating a directory level with `'..'`.

Given these rules, you need to convert an input string representing a file path into its simplified form following the Unix conventions.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The optimal way to solve this problem is by using a stack. Here's the rationale for the solution:

- When you encounter a directory name (not `'.'` or `'..'` or empty), push it onto the stack.
- When you encounter `'.'`, do nothing since it represents the current directory.
- When you encounter `'..'`, pop the top directory from the stack unless the stack is empty, which represents moving up one directory level.
- Consecutive slashes `'//'` or trailing slashes should be ignored by not introducing any new elements into the stack.

After processing the entire path, you will accumulate a simplified path in the stack, which then needs to be constructed into a well-formatted path string.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Here's a Python function that implements the solution:

```python
def simplifyPath(path):
    stack = []
    parts = path.split(""/"")  # Split the path by slashes

    for part in parts:
        if part == '..':     # Move up a directory level
            if stack:
                stack.pop()
        elif part and part != '.':  # Ignore empty parts and current directory marker
            stack.append(part)

    return ""/"" + ""/"".join(stack)  # Join stack elements with a slash and prefix with a slash
```

Now, let's break down this code line by line:

- `stack` is initialized as an empty list, which will function as our stack to hold directory names.
- `parts = path.split(""/"")` splits the input `path` by `'/'`, resulting in a list of directories and possibly empty strings.
- We then iterate over each `part` in `parts`:
    - If `part` is `'..'`, we check if the stack is not empty and `pop` the top element.
    - If `part` is not empty and is not `'.'`, we `append` the `part` to the `stack`, representing a valid directory name.
- After processing all parts, we construct the simplified path string by joining elements in `stack` with a `'/'`. We add a leading `'/'` to ensure the resulting path is absolute.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's consider various examples and how the solution handles them:

1. `/home/`: The path simplifies to `/home`.
2. `/../`: Since `'..'` at the beginning would attempt to go up from the root, it has no effect. The path simplifies to `/`.
3. `/home//foo/`: Consecutive slashes are treated as one, and the path simplifies to `/home/foo`.
4. `/a/./b/../../c/`: This path will be broken down to `[a, ., b, .., .., c]`. The stack transactions will be:
    - Push `a`
    - Skip `.`
    - Push `b`
    - Pop `b` (due to `..`)
    - Pop `a` (due to `..`)
    - Push `c`
    Resulting in a simplified path of `/c`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the length of the input `path`. This is because the algorithm needs to process each character in the path once when splitting it. The stack operations (push and pop) perform in constant time, O(1), so the iteration over parts does not add more than O(N) complexity.

The space complexity is also O(N) because, in the worst case, the stack can store all parts of the path if there are no `'.'` or `'..'` parts.

### Real-World Applications

Simplifying file paths is directly applicable in file system navigation within operating systems, command-line interfaces, or any application that needs to resolve file paths to access files and directories. It's a canonical problem for understanding stack usage and string processing in real-world programming scenarios.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

Common pitfalls include:
- Not handling edge cases, such as trailing slashes or paths consisting entirely of `'..'`.
- Misunderstanding what to do with `'.'` and `'..'` (e.g., pushing `'.'` onto the stack instead of ignoring it).
- Failing to handle consecutive slashes correctly.
  
Specific tricks that can be applied in this problem:
- Using the stack effectively for directory navigation.
- Skipping over empty strings and current directory markers while processing parts.
  
### Problem Pattern Identification

72,"LeetCode problem number 72 refers to the ""Edit Distance"" problem. Let's break down the problem into detailed components and address each one systematically.

### Problem Statement

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

1. **Insert** a character
2. **Delete** a character
3. **Replace** a character

The task is, given two input strings, to find the minimum number of these operations that are needed to transform one string into the other.

### Example

```
Input: word1 = ""horse"", word2 = ""ros""
Output: 3

Explanation:
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

This problem can be approached using dynamic programming because the problem has an optimal substructure (the problem can be broken down into simpler sub-problems) and overlapping subproblems (the same subproblems are solved multiple times).

#### Dynamic Programming Approach

We can create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum edit distance between `word1[0...i-1]` and `word2[0...j-1]`. Here's how we can fill out this matrix:

- **Base cases**: 
  - When either string is empty, the edit distance is equal to the length of the other string (since we need to insert all characters of the non-empty string into the empty one).
  - This means `dp[i][0] = i` for all `i` and `dp[0][j] = j` for all `j`.

- **Transition**: 
  - For `dp[i][j]`, if `word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]`, no operation is required, and `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.
  - If `word1[i-1] != word2[j-1]`, we consider the minimum of the following:
    1. Inserting a character into `word1` (`dp[i][j-1] + 1`)
    2. Deleting a character from `word1` (`dp[i-1][j] + 1`)
    3. Replacing a character in `word1` (`dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`)

By filling out the matrix using these rules, the final answer will be located at `dp[len(word1)][len(word2)]`.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's write the Python code step by step and explain each part in detail:

```python
def minDistance(word1, word2):
    m, n = len(word1), len(word2)
    # Create a DP table with an extra row and column for the base cases
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    # Initialize base cases
    for i in range(m + 1):
        dp[i][0] = i
    for j in range(n + 1):
        dp[0][j] = j

    # Populate the DP table
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i - 1][j],    # Delete
                                   dp[i][j - 1],    # Insert
                                   dp[i - 1][j - 1]) # Replace
    
    return dp[m][n]
```
- `m, n`: Lengths of `word1` and `word2`, respectively.
- `dp`: A 2D list initialized with zeros. It has dimensions `(m + 1) x (n + 1)` to account for base cases when either of the strings is empty.
- `dp[i][0] = i` and `dp[0][j] = j`: Fill in the first row and column based on the base cases.
- Nested `for` loops: Used for filling the DP table using the transitions described earlier.
- `dp[m][n]`: The last cell of the table contains the minimum edit distance and is returned as the result.

### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: Since every cell in the `m x n` matrix is filled exactly once, the time complexity is O(m * n), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the input strings.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is also O(m * n) due to the size of the DP table.

### Real-World Applications

The edit distance problem has many applications in the real world such as:
- Spell checking and correction
- DNA sequencing in bioinformatics to find the similarity between gene sequences
- Natural language processing for text similarity and machine translation systems
- Error detection and correction in network transmissions

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Initializing the base cases correctly: Ensuring that the DP table takes into account the conversions when one string is empty.
- Accounting for off-by-one errors: Remember to subtract 1 when indexing `word1` and `word2` since the DP table starts with an extra row and column for base cases.
- Optimization: In some cases, the space complexity can be improved to O(min(m, n)) by just storing two rows (or columns) at a time since only the current and previous rows are needed.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The Edit Distance problem is a classic example of dynamic programming involving a 2D array (also known as a table-driven approach). Recognizing that the problem involves finding an optimal solution by breaking it down into subproblems is key. This pattern can be applied to solve various other problems involving sequences or substring manipulations, such as the Longest Common Subsequence problem.

### Links to Similar Problems

- LeetCode Problem 1143: Longest Common Subsequence (similar DP approach with 2D array)
- LeetCode Problem 10: Regular Expression Matching (involves complex pattern matching with DP)
- LeetCode Problem 647: Palindromic Substrings (could be solved using a DP approach)
- LeetCode Problem 516: Longest Palindromic Subsequence (also a sequence-related DP problem)

Each of these problems can apply the dynamic programming approach in a similar manner, learning to identify optimal substructures and overlapping subproblems as a recurring pattern. The skillset acquired from solving the Edit Distance problem can directly transfer to approaching these related problems.

This should provide a comprehensive understanding of the Edit Distance problem on LeetCode, including approaching the solution, a breakdown of the code, understanding the complexities, and recognizing the significance and applications of the problem."
73,"LeetCode Problem #73 is titled ""Set Matrix Zeroes"". Let me provide you with an extensive analysis of the problem.

### Problem Statement

You're given an `m x n` matrix. If an element is `0`, you must set its entire row and column to `0`. You must do it in-place without using additional space except for a constant number of variables.

Example:

```
Input: matrix = [
  [1,1,1],
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,1]
]
Output: [
  [1,0,1],
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1]
]
```

In this example, since `matrix[1][1]` is `0`, the second row and second column are set to `0`.

### Constraints

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `-2^31 <= matrix[i][j] <= 2^31 - 1`

The constraints imply that the matrix can be as small as `1x1` and as large as `200x200`, and the elements can be any 32-bit signed integer.

### Understanding the Problem Nuances

One of the nuances of the problem is the requirement to modify the matrix in-place, which means you can't use an auxiliary matrix to track changes. You must find a way to record which rows and columns are to be set to `0` while traversing the matrix without losing the information about which cells were originally `0`.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

There are several ways to approach this problem:

#### Brute Force (Not Recommended)

A simple but inefficient method would be to create a copy of the matrix and use it to mark the rows and columns to be zeroed. This method, however, does not comply with the space complexity requirement.

#### Space Optimized Approach (Recommended)

A more space-efficient approach involves using the first row and the first column of the matrix as markers:

1. Check if the first row and/or the first column contain any `0`s initially (they will act as flags later).
2. Iterate through the rest of the matrix. If you encounter a `0`, mark the corresponding position in the first row and first column.
3. Using the markers in the first row and column, iterate through the rest of the matrix again to set the appropriate rows and columns to `0`.
4. Finally, use the flags from step 1 to update the first row and column.

This approach ensures we don't need additional storage proportional to the size of the matrix, keeping our extra space usage to a constant.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's break down the approach into Python code:

```python
def setZeroes(matrix):
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    first_row_has_zero = any(matrix[0][j] == 0 for j in range(n))
    first_col_has_zero = any(matrix[i][0] == 0 for i in range(m))

    # Mark zeros on the first row and column
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                matrix[i][0] = matrix[0][j] = 0

    # Use the marks to set the zeros
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if matrix[i][0] == 0 or matrix[0][j] == 0:
                matrix[i][j] = 0

    # Set the first row and column to zero if needed
    if first_row_has_zero:
        for j in range(n):
            matrix[0][j] = 0
    if first_col_has_zero:
        for i in range(m):
            matrix[i][0] = 0

# Example usage:
matrix = [
  [1,1,1],
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,1]
]
setZeroes(matrix)
print(matrix)
```

### Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:** The time complexity is O(m * n) because we iterate through the entire matrix a constant number of times (three in the above code).

**Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(1) since we are using the first row and the first column of the input matrix as our marker space and not using any additional data structures that are proportional to the size of the input.

### Real-World Applications

This problem can represent real-life situations such as turning off electricity in certain rows and columns of a grid, or disabling specific rows and columns in a spreadsheet based on certain conditions.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Remember not to start modifying the matrix before marking zeros in the first row and column, as it may result in incorrect modifications.
- Be careful to check the first row and column separately before using them as markers.
- Don't forget to handle the first row and column after processing the rest of the matrix.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem is a variant of in-place matrix transformation. Learning to use the matrix itself for state tracking is a powerful strategy that can apply to other scenarios, including rotation of images (where you might rotate the image within the same matrix), flood-fill algorithms, and game boards where marking is required without extra space.

Let me provide you with a detailed breakdown of the problem, solution strategies, Python code explanations, examples, complexity analysis, real-world applications, common pitfalls, tricks, pattern identification, and links to similar problems.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The problem statement is as follows:
- You are given a m x n matrix of integers where each row is sorted in ascending order from left to right, and the first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
- Your task is to write a function that accepts this matrix and a target integer value. The function should return true if the target value exists in the matrix, and false otherwise.

Let's examine the key aspects of the problem:
- The matrix is two-dimensional, with `m` rows and `n` columns.
- The elements within each row are sorted in ascending order.
- The first element of each row is guaranteed to be greater than the last element of the preceding row, making the entire matrix sorted if it were flattened into a 1D list.
- The ""search space"" is two-dimensional, but because of the sorted order, we can apply search algorithms that are efficient for sorted lists.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
There are several approaches to solve this problem:

1. **Brute Force Approach**: A simple solution would be to iterate over each element of the matrix and compare it with the target. If the target is found, return true; otherwise, false. This approach has an O(m*n) time complexity and is not efficient for large matrices.

2. **Binary Search on Each Row**: Knowing that each row is sorted, one could perform a binary search for the target on each row. This has a time complexity of O(m*log(n)), which is better than the brute force approach, but still not the most efficient due to the sorted nature of the entire matrix.

3. **Binary Search on Matrix Treated as a Sorted List**: The optimal approach is to leverage the fact that the entire matrix can be treated as a sorted list. To do this, we need to map a single index to the two-dimensional matrix. By using integer division and modulus operations, we can simulate this index mapping and then perform a single binary search. The time complexity of this approach is O(log(m*n)), which is the most efficient.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Here's how you would implement the optimal solution using binary search:

```python
def searchMatrix(matrix, target):
    if not matrix:
        return False
    
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    left, right = 0, m * n - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        # Convert 'mid' to 'row' and 'col' to access elements in the matrix.
        mid_element = matrix[mid // n][mid % n]
        
        if mid_element == target:
            return True
        elif mid_element < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half.
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half.
   
    return False
```

Explanation by line:
- We first handle the edge case where the matrix is empty, returning False.
- We then calculate the number of rows `m` and columns `n`.
- We set two variables `left` and `right` to represent the start and end of our ""flattened"" sorted list.
- We enter a while loop, which continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
- Within the loop, we calculate `mid` as the midpoint of `left` and `right`.
- Then we map this `mid` value to its corresponding `row` and `col` in the matrix.
- We check if `mid_element` is equal to the target. If yes, we return True.
- If the `mid_element` is less than the target, we search the right half by updating `left` to `mid + 1`.
- If the `mid_element` is greater than the target, we search the left half by updating `right` to `mid - 1`.
- If we exit the loop without finding the target, we return False.

### Elaborate Examples:
Example 1:
```python
matrix = [
  [1,   3,  5,  7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 50]
]
target = 3
searchMatrix(matrix, target)  # returns True
```

Example 2:
```python
matrix = [
  [1,   3,  5,  7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 50]
]
target = 13
searchMatrix(matrix, target)  # returns False
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity for the binary search approach is O(log(m*n)), as we are performing a binary search over the number of elements in the matrix, which is `m*n`.

The space complexity is O(1), since we are not using any additional data structures that scale with the size of the input.

### Real-World Applications:
This kind of problem is common in search engines, databases, and any situation where a fast lookup is needed within a sorted dataset.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- A common pitfall is to not correctly map the 1D mid index back to the 2D matrix indices. Remember to use integer division and modulus correctly.
- Forgetting to handle the case when the matrix is empty or the target is outside the range of elements in the matrix can lead to errors.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem follows a binary search pattern, which is applicable to a sorted array or an array-like data structure where elements are in increasing or decreasing order.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:
Here are a few related LeetCode problems that also involve applying binary search:
- 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
- 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
- 162. Find Peak Element
- 167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

These problems, while each having unique twists, build on the core concept of using binary search to efficiently find elements or properties in a sorted sequence."
75,"LeetCode Problem 75 is ""Sort Colors,"" which is a medium-difficulty problem often used to test understanding of sorting algorithms and the Dutch National Flag problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of the problem followed by in-depth explanations and code analysis.

### Problem Statement:

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the colors red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

### Constraints:
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem is essentially about sorting an array that contains only three distinct integers (0, 1, and 2) that correspond to colors. The primary challenge is to sort the array with these constraints in mind:

- You cannot use the built-in sort function.
- You need to sort the array in-place, meaning you should not use extra space for another array.
- The order of the colors is predefined (red, white, and blue corresponding to 0, 1, and 2).
- The solution should be efficient in both time and space complexity.

This problem is a variation of the Dutch National Flag problem proposed by Edsger Dijkstra. The problem asks us to partition an array into three parts, each part representing a color.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

A brute-force approach might count the number of 0s, 1s, and 2s in the array and then overwrite the array with the correct number of 0s, then 1s, and finally 2s. However, this is not an in-place solution as it requires two passes through the array.

A more elegant and preferred method is to use three pointers to sort the array in a single pass. This approach is known as the three-way partitioning and often referred to as the Dutch National Flag algorithm:

- A pointer `left` at the start of the array.
- A pointer `right` at the end of the array.
- A pointer `current` that moves from the beginning to the end of the array.

The idea is to move `0s` to the left and `2s` to the right, and leave `1s` in the middle. The process is as follows:

1. Initialize `left` and `current` to the beginning of the array and `right` to the end.
2. Iterate over the array with the `current` pointer.
3. If `nums[current]` is `0`, we swap it with `nums[left]` and increment both `left` and `current`.
4. If `nums[current]` is `2`, we swap it with `nums[right]` and decrement `right`, but do not move `current` because the swapped element needs to be evaluated.
5. If `nums[current]` is `1`, we simply move `current` forward.
6. We continue this process until `current` is greater than `right`.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

```python
def sortColors(nums):
    left, current, right = 0, 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while current <= right:
        if nums[current] == 0:
            nums[left], nums[current] = nums[current], nums[left]
            left += 1
            current += 1
        elif nums[current] == 2:
            nums[right], nums[current] = nums[current], nums[right]
            right -= 1
        else:  # nums[current] == 1
            current += 1
```

Let's break down the code line by line:

- `left, current, right = 0, 0, len(nums) - 1`: Here, we initialize our three pointers. `left` and `current` start at the beginning of the array while `right` starts at the end.
- `while current <= right:`: This loop will run until `current` passes `right`.
- `if nums[current] == 0:`: If the current element is `0`, we swap it with the `left` element (as `0s` should be on the left) and move the `left` and `current` pointers forward.
- `elif nums[current] == 2:`: If the current element is `2`, we swap it with the `right` element (as `2s` should be on the right) and move the `right` pointer backward. Notice that `current` is not incremented here because we need to examine the element that was swapped to `current` from the `right`.
- `else: current += 1`: If the current element is `1`, we simply move `current` forward. `1s` stay in place.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's consider the array `[2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]` and see how the sorting proceeds:

```
Before sorting: [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0]
Initial pointers: left = 0, current = 0, right = 5

1st step, swap nums[0] and nums[5]:
[0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2]
left = 1, current = 1, right = 4

2nd step, left and current both points to `0`, increment both:
[0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2]
left = 2, current = 2, right = 4

3rd step, swap nums[2] and nums[4]:
[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
left = 2, current = 2, right = 3

Now all pointers move forward one step at a time without swaps since nums[2] and nums[3] are `1`:
left = 4, current = 4, right = 3

Sorting is complete.
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: The algorithm makes a single pass through the array, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
- Space Complexity: The algorithm does not use any additional data structures that grow with the input size, so the space complexity is O(1), which is constant space usage.

### Real-World Applications:

The ""Sort Colors"" problem can apply to scenarios where a series of items needs to be arranged based on a limited set of attributes. Such scenarios include:
- Organizing documents or items by predefined categories (e.g., priority levels).
- Segregation of recyclable materials into different bins.
- Grouping of data for rendering, where items might be sorted in layers or z-indexes.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

Common pitfalls in this problem might include:
- Attempting to use a traditional sorting algorithm, which would not be as efficient.
- Not handling the end conditions correctly for the pointers, which might lead to an infinite loop or unsorted elements.
- Mismanaging the increments/decrements of pointers after swaps, leading to incorrectly positioned elements.

Important tricks:
- Increment `current` when you are sure the element at the `current` index is in the right position.
- Do not increment `current` when swapping with `right` because the new element at `current` needs to be checked.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

The problem aligns with the partitioning pattern that is common in quicksort algorithms but with a twist to handle three distinct values. Recognizing this pattern aids in solving other partitioning problems like segregating even and odd numbers, positives and negatives, or elements with respect to a pivot.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:

Several problems involve similar strategies of partitioning or segregating elements in an array:

- [Partition Array into Disjoint Intervals (LeetCode 915)](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-into-disjoint-intervals/)
- [Partition Labels (LeetCode 763)](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/)
- [Partition List (LeetCode 86)](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/)

Each of these problems can be approached with a similar mindset by identifying how the array needs to be divided and carefully managing pointer or index movements."
76,"Problem 76 on LeetCode is the ""Minimum Window Substring"" problem. Here's a detailed breakdown and solution explanation for this problem.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The ""Minimum Window Substring"" problem is stated as follows: Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the minimum window in `s` which will contain all the characters in `t`. If there is no such window in `s` that covers all characters in `t`, return the empty string `""""`.

There are a few points that need to be considered:
1. The order of the characters in `t` is irrelevant, but all must be included in the window in `s`.
2. The window in `s` must contain all characters from `t`, including duplicates. This means if `t` has multiple occurrences of a letter, the window must have at least that many of the same letter.
3. The window can contain additional characters that are not in `t`, and it can also have the characters of `t` in any order.
4. If there are multiple valid windows, the smallest one must be returned, and if there's a tie, the one with the leftmost starting point is preferred.
5. It's guaranteed that the answer is unique for the inputs provided.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

The brute force approach for this problem would be to check all possible windows in `s` to find the minimum window that contains all of `t`'s characters. However, this methodology is inefficient because it would result in time complexity of O(n^2) or worse.

A better approach is the sliding window technique combined with a hash table (or hash map). Here is the basic idea:
1. Use two pointers to create a moving window of characters in `s`.
2. Keep track of the frequency of characters required from `t` using a hash table.
3. Expand the window until it contains all the necessary characters from `t`.
4. Then, contract the window from the left while ensuring that it still contains all characters from `t`.
5. Keep track of the minimum window length and its starting index.
6. Repeat the process of expanding and contracting the window until the end of `s`.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the Python code for this problem:

```python
from collections import Counter

def minWindow(s: str, t: str) -> str:
    if not t or not s:
        return """"
    
    dict_t = Counter(t)
    required = len(dict_t)
    
    # Filter all the characters from s into a new list along with their index.
    # The filtering is done so we process only necessary characters and not all characters of s.
    filtered_s = [(i, char) for i, char in enumerate(s) if char in dict_t]

    l, r = 0, 0
    formed = 0
    window_counts = {}
    
    ans = float(""inf""), None, None  # Length of window, left, right pointers
    
    # Look for the characters only in the filtered list instead of the entire s
    # This helps to reduce our search
    # Hence, we follow the sliding window approach on this new list
    while r < len(filtered_s):
        character = filtered_s[r][1]
        window_counts[character] = window_counts.get(character, 0) + 1

        if window_counts[character] == dict_t[character]:
            formed += 1
        
        # Try and contract the window till the point where it ceases to be 'desirable'.
        while l <= r and formed == required:
            character = filtered_s[l][1]

            # Save the smallest window until now.
            end = filtered_s[r][0]
            start = filtered_s[l][0]
            if end - start + 1 < ans[0]:
                ans = (end - start + 1, start, end)

            window_counts[character] -= 1
            if window_counts[character] < dict_t[character]:
                formed -= 1
            
            l += 1    

        r += 1
    
    return """" if ans[0] == float(""inf"") else s[ans[1] : ans[2] + 1]
```

1. `from collections import Counter` - This imports the Counter class from the collections module, which is used to count the frequency of elements in an iterable.
2. `def minWindow(s: str, t: str) -> str:` - Defines the function `minWindow` with parameters `s` and `t`, both strings, and specifies that it will return a string.
3. `if not t or not s:` - A guard clause that returns an empty string if either `s` or `t` is empty.
4. `dict_t = Counter(t)` - Creates a frequency counter for the characters in `t`.
5. `required = len(dict_t)` - The number of unique characters from `t` that must be present in the window.
6. `filtered_s` - Builds a list of tuples containing the index and character of elements from `s` that are in `t`. This helps concentrate only on relevant characters, reducing computation on larger strings.
7. `l, r = 0, 0` - Initialization of left and right pointers for the sliding window.
8. `formed = 0` - This variable keeps track of how many unique characters from `t` have their required frequency in the current window.
9. `window_counts = {}` - A hash table to count the frequencies of characters in the current window.
10. `ans = float(""inf""), None, None` - A tuple to store the answers (window length, left pointer, right pointer) - initialized to infinity and None values.
11. The while loop `while r < len(filtered_s):` starts the sliding window process.
12. The inner while loop `while l <= r and formed == required:` contracts the window by moving the left pointer and updates the results if a smaller window is found.
13. `return """" if ans[0] == float(""inf"") else s[ans[1] : ans[2] + 1]` - Returns the minimum window or an empty string if no such window exists.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's walk through an example of how this algorithm would work.

Consider the following inputs:
`s = ""ADOBECODEBANC""`
`t = ""ABC""`

Here's what happens step by step:
1. We create `dict_t` from `t`, which now contains `{'A': 1, 'B': 1, 'C': 1}`.
2. `filtered_s` becomes `[(0, 'A'), (3, 'B'), (5, 'E'), (6, 'C'), (7, 'O'), (9, 'D'), (10, 'E'), (11, 'B'), (12, 'A'), (14, 'C'), (15, 'A'), (16, 'N')]`, including only characters from `s` that appear in `t`.
3. The window expands until it covers `A`, `B`, and `C` at least once.
4. Once we have a desirable window, we try to minimize it by moving the left pointer.
5. This process repeats until the right pointer reaches the end of `filtered_s`.

For the given inputs, the smallest window that contains `A`, `B`, and `C` is ""BANC"".

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

Let's consider the number of elements in `s` to be `N` and in `t` to be `M`.

- **Time Complexity**: O(N + M)
    - Creating `dict_t` takes O(M) since we need to count each character in `t`.
    - Filtering `s` into `filtered_s` also takes O(N) since we go through each character in `s`.
    - The sliding window over `filtered_s` takes at most O(N) as each character is visited at most twice (once by the right pointer and once by the left).
    - Overall, the time complexity is O(N + M).
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(N + M)
    - We use `dict_t` which can have at most `M` keys.
    - `filtered_s` contains, at most, `N` elements (when all characters of `s` are in `t`).
    - `window_counts` can have at most `M` keys as it stores counts only for characters from `t`.
    - Thus, the space complexity ends up being O(N + M). If `M` is much smaller than `N`, then we can consider the space complexity to be O(N).

### Real-World Applications:

The ""Minimum Window Substring"" algorithm has practical applications in fields such as:
- **Bioinformatics**: Where one might want to find the shortest sequence in a gene that includes a set of desired factors.
- **Text Analysis**: In information retrieval or analyzing documents to find the smallest snippet that includes a set of keywords.
- **System Log Analysis**: To find the smallest window of logs that include all types of error codes for diagnostics.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- **Off-by-One Errors**: When implementing the sliding window, take care of the indices to prevent off-by-one errors. Ensure you understand how list slicing works and how the pointers move.
- **Character Frequency Matching**: It is crucial to keep an accurate count of characters in the window. Use dictionaries or `Counter` objects to match frequencies.
- **Edge Cases**: Test cases where `s` or `t` are empty, or where `t` contains all unique characters or all identical characters, as these may reveal edge cases.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

The strategy used in the ""Minimum Window Substring"" is a classic example of a two-pointer technique known as the sliding window pattern. It's particularly useful when you need to find a subrange in a linear data structure (like an array or string) that satisfies certain conditions. Recognizing this pattern can help in solving other problems such as ""Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters"", ""Permutation in String"", or ""Substring with Concatenation of All Words"".

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:

Here is a list of related LeetCode problems that utilize a similar approach or variations of the sliding window technique:
- **Problem 3: ""Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters""**
- **Problem 30: ""Substring with Concatenation of All Words""**
- **Problem 159: ""Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters""**
- **Problem 209: ""Minimum Size Subarray Sum""**
- **Problem 567: ""Permutation in String""**
- **Problem 904: ""Fruit Into Baskets""**
- **Problem 930: ""Binary Subarrays With Sum""**

Each of these problems applies the sliding window pattern in different ways, but the core concept of using two pointers to manage a dynamic window remains consistent. Understanding and mastering this pattern through practice will undoubtedly improve your problem-solving skills for array and string-related challenges."
77,"The LeetCode problem 77 is titled ""Combinations"". Here's a detailed breakdown of the problem, including solution strategies and a Python code explanation.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

In this problem, you are given two integers `n` and `k`, and you need to return all possible combinations of `k` numbers out of numbers 1 through `n`. In other words, you need to generate all possible subsets of the set `{1, 2, ..., n}` where each subset is of size `k`.

This is a classic combinatorial problem which requires generating combinations without regard to the order (contrast with permutations, where order matters).

Here are a few nuances and constraints to keep in mind:

- You should only return combinations, meaning the order of numbers in a combination does not matter. For example, `[2, 4]` and `[4, 2]` are considered to be the same combination and therefore only one of them should be included in the final result.
- Each number in a combination should be unique. No number can repeat within the same combination.
- The list of numbers is always a range from 1 to `n` inclusive, so you don't have to deal with arbitrary lists of numbers.
- The combinations should be returned as a list of lists, with each inner list representing a single combination.
- The problem expects you to solve it without using library functions for generating combinations. Thus, you're expected to implement the combinatorial logic yourself.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, there are several strategies, but a common and efficient way is to use backtracking. Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions and abandons a candidate (""backtracks"") as soon as it determines that this candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

Here is a step-by-step strategy using backtracking:

1. Start with an empty combination.
2. Add the next number in the range to the combination.
3. If the combination has `k` numbers, add it to the output list.
4. Else, continue to add the next number in the range.
5. Once youâ€™ve tried all possibilities with the current first number, remove the last number from the combination (backtrack) and try the next number.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's represent this strategy in Python code:

```python
def combine(n, k):
    def backtrack(start, path):
        # If the path length is k, add it to the output
        if len(path) == k:
            output.append(path[:])
            return
        
        # Try all possible next choices
        for i in range(start, n + 1):
            path.append(i)       # Make a choice
            backtrack(i + 1, path) # Continue with the next number
            path.pop()           # Backtrack and remove the last number added

    output = []
    backtrack(1, [])
    return output
```

In this code:

- `combine` is the main function responsible for initializing the output list and invoking the `backtrack` function.
- `backtrack` is a helper function defined inside `combine` that takes two arguments: `start` (the starting number for the current combination) and `path` (the current combination being built).
- If `path` has reached the length `k`, it's added to the `output` list after creating a shallow copy using `path[:]`.
- The `for` loop within `backtrack` iterates from the `start` number to `n`, attempting to extend `path` with each number.
- After an attempt to extend `path`, we recursively call `backtrack` with the updated `path` and `i+1` as the new starting number.
- After exploring each subtree of the recursive call tree, we need to backtrack by popping the last number to revert `path` to its prior state.
- Finally, after backtracking completes, we return the `output`.

### Elaborate Examples

Here are some examples illustrating how the algorithm works:

Example 1: If `n = 4` and `k = 2`, the output would be:
```
[
  [1, 2],
  [1, 3],
  [1, 4],
  [2, 3],
  [2, 4],
  [3, 4]
]
```

Example 2: If `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the output would be:
```
[
  [1]
]
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n C k), where C stands for the binomial coefficient, which is used to calculate the number of combinations `(n choose k)`. This reflects the number of recursive calls made.

The space complexity is O(k), because the depth of the recursion tree is `k` (the size of each combination), and we use additional space to store the `output`, which also contains `n C k` combinations. However, since the problem considers `output` as part of the result and not space used for the purpose of computation, we typically say the auxiliary space complexity (additional space excluding output storage) is O(k).

### Real-World Applications

Applications of generating combinations include but are not limited to:

- Designing statistical experiments where you need to consider all possible samples of a specific size.
- Enumerating subsets for brute force algorithms in areas like subset-sum problems or search problems.
- Building teams or groups where the order of members does not matter.
- Analyzing lottery games and probabilities.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

Common pitfalls in implementing a backtracking solution include:

- Not making a copy of the current path before adding it to the output, which results in all entries being references to the same path list, reflecting only the final state.
- Forgetting to backtrack, which would fail to explore all possibilities.
- Off-by-one errors, especially in the loop range, can miss possible numbers to be included in the combinations or lead to invalid access.

One trick often used is to use slicing (`path[:]`) to create a shallow copy of the list before adding it to the output to avoid modifying the stored paths during backtracking.

78,"LeetCode problem 78 is ""Subsets,"" which is a classic problem to test your understanding of backtracking and bit manipulation. I'll provide an extensive breakdown of the problem, potential solutions, and detailed Python code explanations.

### Problem Breakdown:

Given an integer array `nums` of unique elements, the task is to return all possible subsets (the power set). The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets and can be returned in any order.

Here are the constraints to keep in mind:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10
- -10 <= nums[i] <= 10
- All the numbers of nums are unique.

#### Subtle Nuances Affecting the Solution:

- The elements in `nums` are unique, which means we do not need to worry about handling duplicates in the subsets.
- The problem doesn't specify the subsets to be in any particular order, so the elements in a subset do not need to be sorted.
- The power set includes the empty set and the set itself.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

There are two classic approaches to this problem: backtracking (also known as the recursive approach) and bit manipulation.

#### Backtracking Approach:
Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems, especially for constraint satisfaction problems. Hereâ€™s how it works for the ""Subsets"" problem:
1. Start with an empty list to collect subsets.
2. Initiate a recursive function to generate subsets.
3. In the recursive function, loop through the elements starting from a given index and add each element to the current subset.
4. Every time you add an element to the current subset, recurse further with the new subset and increment the index.
5. Make sure to add the subset to the collection before you add a new element to it (to include subsets of all possible sizes).
6. Backtrack by removing the last added element before going to the next iteration of the loop.

#### Bit Manipulation Approach:
Each subset can be represented by a bitmask of length equal to the number of elements in the input list, `nums`. Hereâ€™s the thought process:
1. There are 2^n possible subsets, where n is the number of elements in `nums`.
2. Generate all possible bitmasks from `0` to `2^n - 1`.
3. A `1` in the bitmask at position `i` means the element at index `i` in `nums` is included in the subset.
4. Iterate through all these bitmasks and form the corresponding subsets based on which bits are set to `1`.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Hereâ€™s how the backtracking approach could be implemented in Python:

```python
def subsets(nums):
    def backtrack(start, path):
        # This line ensures we add the current subset to the result
        # before we start adding more elements to it.
        res.append(path[:])
        for i in range(start, len(nums)):
            # Include nums[i] into the current subset
            path.append(nums[i])
            # Continue exploring with nums[i] included
            backtrack(i + 1, path)
            # Backtrack to explore subsets without nums[i]
            path.pop()

    res = []
    backtrack(0, [])
    return res
```

For the bit manipulation approach, the implementation looks like this:

```python
def subsets(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    output = []
    # For each bitmask from 0 to 2^n - 1
    for i in range(2**n, 2**(n+1)):
        # Generate a bitmask, remove the leading '1' and '0b' 
        bitmask = bin(i)[3:]
        
        # Append the subset corresponding to the current bitmask
        output.append([nums[j] for j in range(n) if bitmask[j] == '1'])
    return output
```

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's illustrate the above code with an example. Suppose `nums = [1, 2, 3]`.

Using backtracking, the recursive stack would unfold something like this:

- start with `subset = []`, add it to `res`
- add `1` to `subset`, making it `[1]`, and recurse further
- ... add `2` to `subset`, making it `[1, 2]`, recurse further
- ...... add `3` to `subset` making it `[1, 2, 3]`, no more elements to add, pop `3`
- ... pop `2`, add `3` to `subset` making it `[1, 3]`, no more elements to add, pop `3`
- pop `1`, add `2` to `subset`, making it `[2]`, ...
- ... and so on.

The resulting `res` will be `[[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3]]`.

Using bit manipulation, we evaluate 2^3=8 masks from `""000""` to `""111""` corresponding to `[[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

#### Backtracking Approach:
- Time complexity: O(2^N * N). There are 2^N possible subsets and it takes O(N) time to copy each subset into the output list.
- Space complexity: O(N). The space is used by the recursion stack; it goes as deep as the number of elements in `nums`.

#### Bit Manipulation Approach:
- Time complexity: O(2^N * N). We iterate through 2^N bitmasks and for each, we may collect up to N elements.
- Space complexity: O(1). If we don't count space needed for the output, only constant extra space is used.

### Real-World Applications:

The concept of generating subsets has applications in generating combinations for lotteries, creating power sets in set theory, solving problems in computational biology (like finding all possible sets of genes), and many optimization problems where we need to consider all possible selections of components.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Forgetting to use a deep copy (like `path[:]`) can result in all entries in the result list referring to the same subset as it evolves, which is incorrect.
- When using bit manipulation, make sure to process bitmasks with enough bits (e.g., `2^n` to `2^(n+1)` instead of `0` to `2^n - 1`) to ensure all subsets are covered.
- Recursion base cases are crucial; not having them or setting them incorrectly can lead to infinite recursion.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem fits into the ""backtracking"" pattern. Recognizing this pattern is essential for solving other problems which require exploring all possible combinations or permutations, like generating parentheses, combination sums, and permutation problems.

Learning how to generate subsets efficiently with backtracking or bit manipulation will undoubtedly help in solving these problems and others that require thorough exploration of all possible combinations or states."
79,"LeetCode Problem #79 is titled ""Word Search"" and it is a medium-difficulty problem that requires depth-first search (DFS) and backtracking to solve. Let's break down the problem and then discuss the solution strategies.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
In this problem, you are given a 2D board of characters and a word. You need to determine if the given word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where ""adjacent"" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in constructing the word.

Here are some key points to consider:
- The board will be represented as a list of lists, where each element represents a character.
- A word can be constructed from letters that are contiguous in a straight lineâ€”up, down, left, or rightâ€”from a given starting point.
- You cannot reuse a single letter position more than once for a given word.
- You need to return a boolean value indicating if it is possible to construct the word on the board.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
The solution to this problem is based on backtracking and DFS. Essentially, the algorithm involves the following steps:
1. Iterate over each cell in the 2D grid.
2. For each cell, if it matches the first character of the word, start a DFS search from that cell.
3. In the DFS, explore the 4 possible directions (up, down, left, right), and for each valid direction, check the next character of the word.
4. If a direction leads to the next character, continue the DFS with the remaining characters of the word, marking the current cell as used.
5. If the current path does not lead to a solution, backtrack and mark the current cell as unused.
6. If all the characters of the word are found in the correct sequence, return True.
7. If the entire board is explored without finding the sequence, return False.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
We will now discuss a Python code solution for this problem in detail. (Please note that while we will discuss a generic solution here, variations might exist based on specific implementation preferences.)

```python
def exist(board, word):
    def dfs(board, word, index, x, y):
        if index == len(word):
            return True
        if x < 0 or x >= len(board) or y < 0 or y >= len(board[0]) or word[index] != board[x][y]:
            return False
        temp, board[x][y] = board[x][y], '/'  # mark as visited
        found = (dfs(board, word, index + 1, x + 1, y) or
                 dfs(board, word, index + 1, x - 1, y) or
                 dfs(board, word, index + 1, x, y + 1) or
                 dfs(board, word, index + 1, x, y - 1))
        board[x][y] = temp  # unmark, backtrack
        return found

    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if dfs(board, word, 0, i, j):
                return True
    return False
```

Line by line explanation:
- The `exist` function is what we will call to determine if the word can be found in the board. It takes two parameters: `board` and `word`.
- The `dfs` function is a helper function that performs the depth-first search. It takes five arguments: the `board`, the `word`, the current `index` in the word, and coordinates (`x`, `y`) indicating the current position on the board.
- The base case for the DFS is when the `index` equals the length of the `word`, which means that every character has been successfully found and matched on the board, thus returning `True`.
- The next lines perform bounds checking and match checking. If we're out of bounds or the current cell doesn't match the word's current character, we return `False`.
- We temporarily mark the current cell as visited by replacing its value with `'/'`, to avoid revisiting it.
- We then explore the 4 possible directions from the current cell by calling the `dfs` function recursively and incrementing the `index`.
- If none of the direction explores successfully, we backtrack by restoring the original cell value.
- We iterate over every cell in the board and call the `dfs` function `if` that cell starts with the first character of the word. If any call to `dfs` returns `True`, we return `True` from the `exist` function.
- If the whole board is checked without success, we return `False`.

### Elaborate Examples
Let's take a look at two examples:

Example 1:
```plaintext
board = [
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]
word = ""ABCCED""
```
Here, starting from the top left 'A', the sequence 'ABCCED' can be found by moving right to 'B', down to 'C', right to the next 'C', up to 'E', and left to 'D'. Therefore, `exist(board, word)` should return `True`.

Example 2:
```plaintext
board = [
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]
word = ""ABCB""
```
This word cannot be constructed because the letter 'B' would have to be used twice. Therefore, `exist(board, word)` should return `False`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this solution is O(N * 4^L), where N is the number of cells in the board and L is the length of the word. Here's why:
- For each cell, we potentially explore 4 directions in our DFS.
- With each recursive call, the maximum number of directions to explore decreases by one since we mark the current cell as visited.
- However, in the worst case, we might explore all 4 directions for every character in the word.

The space complexity is O(L) due to the call stack during the recursive calls, where L is the length of the word.

### Real-World Applications
Searching for a word in a grid is a simplified version of many real-world problems:
- In word games like Boggle or Scrabble, this algorithm can be used to check for the existence of a word on the board.
- In electronic design automation, similar algorithms can be utilized for pathfinding on a grid representing a circuit board.
- In robotics, pathfinding algorithms like DFS are often applied in navigation and exploration tasks.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks
- Make sure not to revisit already visited cells in the board during the DFS search.
- Handle the base case properly. It's important to check if all characters have been found in the correct sequence.
- Restoring the state after each DFS search (backtracking) is crucial to avoid affecting other potential paths.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem illustrates a classic backtracking and search pattern in which we explore multiple paths to find a solution and backtrack when a path doesn't lead to a solution.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems
Other LeetCode problems that involve backtracking and/or depth-first search include:
- Combinations (LeetCode #77)
- Permutations (LeetCode #46)
- N-Queens (LeetCode #51)
- Sudoku Solver (LeetCode #37)
- Palindrome Partitioning (LeetCode #131)

All these problems require exploring multiple potential solutions and backtracking when a particular path does not lead to a valid solution. The skills learned from solving the Word Search problem can be transferred to these problems, as they all utilize similar recursive backtracking techniques."
80,"LeetCode Problem #80 is titled ""Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II,"" and the problem statement is as follows:

""Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` after placing the final result in the first `k` slots of `nums`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.""

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```python
nums = [...]; # Input array
expectedNums = [...]; # The expected answer with correct length

k = removeDuplicates(nums); # Calls your implementation

assert k == len(expectedNums);
for i in range(k):
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
```

You need to implement the following function:

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums: List[int]) -> int:
```

**Example 1:**

Input: `nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]`
Output: `5`, `nums = [1,1,2,2,3, _]`
Explanation: Your function should return `k = 5`, with the first five elements of `nums` being `1, 1, 2, 2, and 3` respectively. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned `k` (hence they are underscores).

**Example 2:**

Input: `nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]`
Output: `7`, `nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3, _, _]`
Explanation: Your function should return `k = 7`, with the first seven elements being `0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, and 3` respectively. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned `k` (hence they are underscores).

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Solution Strategy:**

The goal is to modify the array in-place, such that each unique element does not appear more than twice. As the array is already sorted, duplicates will be contiguous. 

A two-pointer approach is an optimal strategy here. One pointer (`i`) iterates over the array, and another (`k`) keeps track of the position where the next non-duplicate element should be placed. 

We can iterate over `nums` starting from the second element (index 1), and compare the current element with the one at position `k - 2`. If they are different, we can safely copy the current element value to `nums[k]` and increment `k`. If they are the same, it means we have encountered more than two duplicates, and we do not increment `k`, which essentially skips the current element.

Let's translate this approach into a Python function and analyze it further. Here is a step-by-step implementation:

```python
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if len(nums) <= 2:
        return len(nums)
    
    k = 2
    for i in range(2, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != nums[k - 2]:
            nums[k] = nums[i]
            k += 1
            
    return k
```

In this function:
- We first handle edge cases where the length of `nums` is 2 or less. In such cases, we simply return the length, as there is no need for any alterations.
- We initialize `k` to 2, because we know the first two elements are always part of the final array (since each unique element is allowed to appear twice).
- We then iterate from the third element to the end of the `nums` array.
- If the current element is different from the element at two places before the current position of `k`, we copy the current element to the `k`th position and increment `k`.
- We increment `k` only when we find an element that does not have more than two duplicates. This is the critical part of the solution.
- Finally, we return `k`, which is the number of elements after removing excessive duplicates.

**Time Complexity Analysis:**

- Each element in the array is checked exactly once, which gives us an O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in `nums`.

**Space Complexity Analysis:**

- Since the input array is modified in place and no additional data structures are used, the space complexity is O(1).

**Real-World Applications:**

- This problem can represent scenarios where you need to deduplicate entries in a log file, but still want to keep some duplicates if they occur within a certain threshold (in this case, at most twice).
- This could also be seen in database deduplication processes where certain records are allowed to have a limited number of duplicates, such as retaining only the latest two transaction records for a particular ID.

**Common Pitfalls:**

- One could mistakenly check for duplicate values by comparing `nums[i]` against `nums[k - 1]` (the previous element instead of two places back), which would incorrectly handle the case where two duplicates are allowed.
- It can be tempting to use an additional array to construct the result, but that would violate the constraint of O(1) additional space.

**Similar Problems:**

Some similar problems that you may encounter and can practice include:
- ""Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II"" (LeetCode #82)
- ""Remove Element"" (LeetCode #27)
- ""Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array"" (LeetCode #26), which is a simpler version of this problem where each element can only appear once.

By mastering the technique used in this problem, you'll be better equipped to deal with other array manipulation challenges where you need to modify an array in place, often using the two-pointer technique."
81,"LeetCode problem number 81 is ""Search in Rotated Sorted Array II,"" which is a follow-up to the problem ""Search in Rotated Sorted Array."" This problem adds complexity to the original by allowing duplicates within the array, which can affect the binary search approach. Here's a breakdown of the problem and how to solve it.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

Imagine an array of integers that was initially sorted in ascending order, then some numbers at the beginning of the array got moved to the end, creating a rotation. The task is to determine if a given target value exists in such a rotated array. The catch here is that the array may contain duplicates, which means that simply comparing values at the middle and ends of the array may not be sufficient to decide which part of the array to continue the search in.

An example input array could look like this: `[1, 1, 3, 1]`, which seems like it's been rotated. If we're looking for the target `3`, we have to figure out a way to navigate through the duplicates.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

One approach is to linearly iterate through the array to find the target, which would have a time complexity of O(n). However, this approach does not leverage the sorted and rotated characteristics of the array.

A binary search algorithm, which has a logarithmic time complexity of O(log n) in the best case, is more efficient. This problem, however, needs a modification of the regular binary search because of the presence of duplicates.

#### Approach:

1. Start with regular binary search, with two pointers marking the start and end of the search range.
2. Check if the middle element is the target. If yes, return `True`.
3. If elements at start, middle, and end are equal, we cannot determine the pivot part; hence, we reduce the search space from both ends and continue.
4. Determine which part of the array is in proper sorted order by comparing start, middle, and end elements.
5. Finally, decide whether to bring our search to the left or the right portion of the array based on the target's value.

Because of duplicates, we need to consider cases where a regular binary search would mislead us into the wrong half of the array.

#### Example:

Consider an array `[2, 5, 6, 0, 0, 1, 2]` and a target of `0`:
- The middle element is `0`, so we've found our target.

However, if the middle element were `5`, and the start element were also `5` (as in the array `[5, 5, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`), we couldn't be sure if the pivot point is to the left or right of the middle. 

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's implement this approach in Python.

```python
def search(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return True

        # If we can't decide where the pivot is.
        if nums[left] == nums[mid] == nums[right]:
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        # If the left half is sorted.
        elif nums[left] <= nums[mid]:
            if nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        # If the right half is sorted.
        else:
            if nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
    return False
```

Here's the breakdown of the code:

- We start with setting `left` and `right` pointers at the beginning and end of the array.
- Through each iteration of the while loop, we calculate `mid` as the index halfway between `left` and `right`.
- We check if `nums[mid]` is equal to the target and return `True` if they match.
- If the elements at `nums[left]`, `nums[mid]`, and `nums[right]` are all the same, we increment `left` and decrement `right` to skip over the duplicates.
- If the left half is non-rotated (sorted), we check if the target is within the range of the left half. If it is, we move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`, otherwise, we move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.
- If the left half is rotated, we're sure that the right half is sorted. We then check if the target is within the right half's range, and adjust our pointers accordingly.
- The loop continues until `left` passes `right`, meaning the target is not present in the array. Then the function returns `False`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n) in the best case which is when there are no duplicates, but it degrades to O(n) in the worst case, when the array has many duplicates since we might need to move one step at a time through the duplicates.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we're only using constant additional space for the pointers and variables, regardless of the size of the input array.

### Real-World Applications:

This type of search algorithm can be useful in instances where quick searching is important, but some ambiguity might exist in the dataset, such as repeated values or data that have been partially transformed in some predictable way.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Not properly handling duplicates can lead to the wrong part of the array, making this problem tricky in the presence of duplicates.
- It's vital to cover edge cases where all numbers are duplicates, or where the target is at the start or end of the array.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem exemplifies a situation where a binary search is complicated by the presence of duplicates and requires additional checks. Anytime a binary search is used in a slightly modified scenario can be seen as a variation of this pattern.

82,"LeetCode Problem 82 is titled ""Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II,"" and here is a comprehensive breakdown of the problem along with an in-depth analysis and solution strategy. 

### Problem Breakdown

The problem states that you are given the head of a sorted linked list, where some elements may be repeated. Your task is to delete all nodes that have duplicates, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. The returned list should also be sorted.

#### Subtle Nuances
- The linked list is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
- We are not just removing duplicate nodes but also the nodes that have appeared more than once. This means that if a value appears multiple times in the list, all instances of that value should be removed from the list completely.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The key to solving this problem lies in understanding how to traverse a linked list while keeping track of duplicates. Since the list is sorted, all duplicates will be adjacent. There are a few methods to approach this problem:

#### Method 1: Sentinel Head + Predecessor

Since the head of the list can also be a duplicate and thus removed, it is often easier to start with a fake ""sentinel"" node whose next pointer points to the head of the list. Here's the step-by-step strategy using this method:

1. Initialize a sentinel node and a predecessor pointer which points to this sentinel node.
2. Traverse the list with a current pointer.
3. Check for duplicates by comparing the current node's value to the value of the next node.
4. Continue moving forward as long as there are duplicates.
5. Once you reach the end of duplicates, point the predecessor's next to the current's next, effectively removing the duplicates.
6. Move the predecessor pointer only if no duplicates were found.

#### Method 2: Recursive Approach

The recursive approach will process the list from back to front:
1. Recur until you find the last node or a node that is different from its next node (i.e., not a duplicate).
2. On the way back from recursion, decide whether to keep or discard each node based on whether it is a duplicate.

Both methods essentially do the same work but differ in how they traverse and handle the nodes.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Below is a Python function implementing the Sentinel Head + Predecessor method, as it's easier to visualize for those unfamiliar with recursion.

83,"LeetCode Problem #83 is called ""Remove Duplicates from Sorted List"". This problem falls under the category of linked list manipulation. Let's break down the problem, propose a solution, and go through it in detail.

### Problem Breakdown

Given the head of a sorted linked list, the task is to delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. The function should return the head of the revised linked list.

Here is what the problem explicitly specifies:

- The linked list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The function should modify the list in place, which means it should not create a new list but alter the existing one.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The key to solving this problem lies in capitalizing on the fact that the list is already sorted. This means that any duplicates will be adjacent to each other.

The general strategy is as follows:

1. Traverse the linked list starting from the head node.
2. At each step, check if the current node has the same value as the next node.
3. If they are equal, adjust the links to bypass the duplicate node.
4. Continue this process until the entire list has been traversed.

Here, we favor an iterative approach over recursion for its simplicity and for avoiding the potential stack overflow that could result from recursion if the list is very long.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

The implementation in Python would look something like this:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def deleteDuplicates(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    current = head
    while current and current.next:
        if current.val == current.next.val:
            current.next = current.next.next
        else:
            current = current.next
    return head
```

Let's break this down line by line:

- The `ListNode` class is the definition of a node in the linked list.
- `deleteDuplicates` is the function we are to implement, which accepts the `head` of the linked list.
- Inside the function, we define a variable `current` that will be used to traverse the list. Initially, it's set to the `head`.
- The `while` loop is the core of the algorithm. It will continue as long as `current` and `current.next` are not `None`. The latter condition is essential to avoid a `NoneType` error when accessing `current.next.val`.
- Inside the loop, we compare the value of the current node with the value of the next node.
- If they are the same (`current.val == current.next.val`), we bypass the next node by setting `current.next` to `current.next.next`.
- If they are not the same, we move to the next node in the list by updating `current` to `current.next`.
- Finally, we return the `head` of the modified list.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's go through an example step by step:

- Given: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3
- Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3

Here's how the function operates:

1. Start at the first node (value 1).
2. Compare to the next node, which is also 1. Since they are the same, remove the duplicate.
3. Move to the next distinct value (now at node with value 2).
4. No duplicate for value 2, so move to the next node (first node with value 3).
5. Compare to the next node, also 3. Remove the duplicate.
6. We've reached the end of the list, so we're done.

### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We visit each node once, and the number of operations per node is constant, except for the potential deallocation of the bypassed nodes, which is also a constant-time operation.

The space complexity is O(1) as we're using a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

### Real-World Applications

This type of problem has practical applications in database querying where deduplication is a common task. It also serves as a fundamental operation in data processing pipelines where unique records need to be maintained.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Remember to check for the end of the list (`current.next` is not `None`) to avoid accessing attributes of `None`.
- Do not forget to handle edge cases where the list could be empty (i.e., the head is `None`).

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem illustrates the ""two-pointer"" technique, although in this specific case, we manage with a single moving pointer because the list is sorted. For other unsorted list variants, two pointers are commonly used.

### Related LeetCode Problems

84,"LeetCode Problem #84 is titled ""Largest Rectangle in Histogram"". This problem falls under the category of stack data structures and algorithms. Let me provide you with an extensive breakdown of the problem and its solution.

### Problem Statement

Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

### Understanding the Problem

A histogram is a graphical representation of data where each bar's height represents some quantity, and all bars are placed adjacent to each other with no space in between. In this problem, each bar has a width of 1, and we need to find the maximal rectangular area that can be formed within the bounds of the histogram bars.

Here are some nuanced points to consider:

- The height of the histogram bars is given by an array of non-negative integers.
- The width of each bar is uniform and is given as 1 unit.
- A rectangle's area is calculated as its height multiplied by its width. In the context of the histogram, the height of the rectangle is determined by the shortest bar within the desired range (since the rectangle cannot exceed this height), and the width is determined by how many consecutive bars you can include in the rectangle.
- We are looking for the largest such possible rectangle area, not just any rectangle.

### Solution Strategy

There are several approaches to solving this problem, such as the brute force method, divide and conquer, and using a stack. For the purposes of this explanation, I will focus on the stack-based approach because it provides an efficient solution.

The main idea behind this solution is to maintain a stack that stores indices of the bars. The stack is used to find the next smaller bar of every bar in the histogram which gives the bounds of the rectangle with the histogram bar as height.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate through each bar in the histogram.
3. While the stack is not empty and the current bar height is less than the height of the bar at the index at the top of the stack, it means we've found a smaller bar, and we can calculate the area:
    - Pop the top of the stack (this index represents the height of the rectangle to compute).
    - Calculate the area using the popped height and the width determined by the current index and the new top of the stack after popping (i.e., distance between the current index and the bar left in the stack).
    - Update the answer with the maximum area obtained so far.
4. Push the current index to the stack.
5. After the iteration, process the remaining indices in the stack (which will have bars of ascending height) using the same area calculation method.
6. The final answer is the maximum area calculated during the process.

### Example

Let's illustrate the approach with a small example:

```
Heights array: [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3]
```

- We start with an empty stack.
- As we iterate, we push indices 0, 1 into the stack.
- At index 2, since 5 > 1, we push index 2 into the stack.
- At index 3, since 6 > 5, push index 3 into the stack.
- At index 4, since 2 < 6, we pop the top of the stack (index 3) and calculate the area with height 6 and width (4 - 2) = 2 units. Hence area = 12, which we record if it's the largest so far.
- Continue popping from the stack and calculating areas as long as the stack top is greater than the current height. So we calculate the area with height 5 and width (4 - 1) = 3 units, hence area = 15.
- We now push index 4 to the stack, since it has no smaller to its left anymore, and repeat the process for index 5.

### Python Code Explanation

The Python code will follow the stack-based approach described above. We will perform a detailed analysis of the code after implementing it.

### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the stack-based solution is O(n), where n is the number of bars in the histogram. This is because each bar is pushed to and popped from the stack exactly once. The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case, when all bars are pushed to the stack (e.g., when the input array is sorted in ascending order).

Now let's implement the stack-based solution in Python and then discuss the code in detail."
85,"LeetCode Problem 85 is titled ""Maximal Rectangle"". This problem falls under the category of dynamic programming and involves a deep understanding of how to optimize the search for the largest area of a rectangle in a binary matrix.

## Problem Statement

Given a rows x cols binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

## Example

```
Input: matrix = [
  [""1"",""0"",""1"",""0"",""0""],
  [""1"",""0"",""1"",""1"",""1""],
  [""1"",""1"",""1"",""1"",""1""],
  [""1"",""0"",""0"",""1"",""0""]
]
Output: 6
Explanation: The maximal rectangle is shown in the above grid with an area of 6.
```

## Extensive Problem Breakdown

The problem can be visualized as looking for the largest rectangle consisting of contiguous 1's within a two-dimensional matrix. The rectangle can be of any size and not necessarily square. A few key points about the problem:

1. The input is a binary matrix, meaning each element is either '0' or '1'.
2. The contiguous rectangle of 1â€™s can be formed from both the horizontal and vertical adjacency of the ones.
3. The result should be the area of the largest rectangle found, not the rectangle itself.

This problem is akin to the largest rectangle in a histogram problem but in a two-dimensional space. The challenge lies not only in finding the rectangle but in doing so efficiently, as a straightforward approach could lead to excessive time complexity that won't satisfy the constraints of larger test cases.

## In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, a dynamic programming approach can be employed. One popular method is to enhance the 'largest rectangle in a histogram' problem solution to fit the two-dimensional nature of this problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of that strategy:

1. Prepare a 'height' array which will represent the height of histograms for each row.
2. Traverse the matrix row by row, updating the heights array. If the matrix element is '1', you increment the corresponding height, if it's '0', you reset the height to zero.
3. For each row (now converted into a histogram), use an algorithm similar to the one used for solving the 'largest rectangle in a histogram'. This usually involves a stack to keep track of the heights and their positions.
4. Keep track of the maximum area seen so far while iterating over the rows.
5. After processing all rows, the maintained maximum area will be the result.

There are other solution strategies, including:
- Brute force (Checking all possible rectangles) â€“ Not efficient and will lead to a timeout for larger input.
- Optimized brute force with pruning â€“ Slightly better but still not sufficient for the largest test cases.
- Divide and conquer â€“ More complicated and doesn't necessarily provide a better time complexity than the dynamic programming approach.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation

The most efficient solution in Python employs dynamic programming and has the following components:

1. Iterate through each row to convert the '1's and '0's into integers.
2. For each row, construct and update the height histogram.
3. Apply the ""largest rectangle in histogram"" logic for each histogram generated.

Let's go over a detailed Python code for this approach. We will provide the complete code afterward to maintain the flow of explanation."
86,"LeetCode Problem 86 is titled ""Partition List"". Below is an in-depth analysis of the problem, potential solution strategies, Python code explanations, and complexity analyses.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem statement is as follows:

Given a linked list and a value `x`, partition it such that all nodes less than `x` come before nodes greater than or equal to `x`.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.
For example:

Given `1->4->3->2->5->2`, and `x` = 3,
return `1->2->2->4->3->5`.

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 200].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
- -200 <= x <= 200

Key aspects to note:
- The partition must be performed around the value `x`.
- Nodes with values less than `x` should come before nodes with values equal to or greater than `x`.
- The relative order of nodes with values less than `x`, as well as the relative order of nodes with values greater than or equal to `x`, must be maintained.
- The problem does not require sorting the elements; it only requires partitioning.
- This is a problem on linked lists, which means solutions that involve indexing as with arrays will not work here. Instead, list node pointers need to be manipulated.
- Handling edge cases, such as an empty list or all elements greater or lesser than `x`, is important.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

We can solve this problem using the two-pointer technique where we maintain two separate linked lists:
1. One list (`less_head`) will keep track of elements less than `x`.
2. The other list (`greater_head`) will keep track of elements greater than or equal to `x`.

We iterate through the original list, and based on the value of each node, we append it to the respective list (`less_head` or `greater_head`). After we finish scanning the original list, we merge the two lists by setting the next pointer of the last node in the `less_head` list to the first node in the `greater_head` list.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Here's how we can implement this solution step by step in Python:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def partition(head, x):
    # Create dummy nodes for the beginning of the less and greater lists
    less_head = ListNode(0)
    greater_head = ListNode(0)
    # These pointers will be used to append nodes to the respective lists
    less = less_head
    greater = greater_head
    
    # Iterate through the original list
    while head:
        # If the current node's value is less than x
        if head.val < x:
            less.next = head
            less = less.next
        else:
            # If the current node's value is greater than or equal to x
            greater.next = head
            greater = greater.next
        head = head.next
    
    # Now that we've exhausted the original list,
    # we should also terminate the `greater` list properly.
    greater.next = None
    
    # Merge the two lists by connecting the `less` list to the `greater` list
    less.next = greater_head.next
    
    # The beginning of the `less` list had a dummy node, so we need to skip it.
    return less_head.next
```
- We start by creating dummy nodes for `less_head` and `greater_head`. These dummy nodes are a common technique used in linked list problems to simplify edge case handling (e.g., an empty list).
- We then iterate through the original list. Each node is checked against `x`, and depending on whether the node's value is less than `x` or not, it is appended to the `less` list or the `greater` list.
- Once the original list is exhausted, we ensure the `greater` list is properly terminated by setting the `next` of its last node to `None`.
- We connect the `less` and `greater` lists and return the `next` of the `less_head` dummy node, which points to the head of the new partitioned list.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's walk through the given example with `x=3` and the list `1->4->3->2->5->2`:

1. Start with two dummy nodes for `less_head` and `greater_head`.
2. Iterate through each node:
   - `1` is less than `3`: append to `less`.
   - `4` is not less than `3`: append to `greater`.
   - `3` is not less than `3`: append to `greater`.
   - `2` is less than `3`: append to `less`.
   - `5` is not less than `3`: append to `greater`.
   - `2` is less than `3`: append to `less`.
3. After iteration, we get two lists: `less` is `1->2->2` and `greater` is `4->3->5`.
4. Append `greater` to the end of `less` to get `1->2->2->4->3->5`.
5. Return the head of the `less` list which is the partitioned list.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the list. This is because we iterate through all nodes exactly once.
- Space complexity: O(1) as we're only using a constant amount of extra space for pointers and dummy nodes; the number of these does not scale with the number of nodes in the input list.

### Real-World Applications:

This problem can be related to partitioning elements in many real-world scenarios, such as:
- Organizing files based on a certain property (size, type, etc.) while maintaining their original order.
- Sorting emails into different folders based on priority, again preserving the order of arrival.
- Grouping products in a warehouse based on their category for efficient retrieval but keeping the batch ordering.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- Forgetting to set `greater.next = None` can result in a cycle in the list.
- Not using dummy nodes can complicate the process, especially when dealing with edge cases such as an empty list or all nodes being less than or greater than `x`.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem exemplifies the two-pointer technique in a linked list context and emphasizes the importance of preserving order, which is typical when dealing with linked lists. Recognizing this pattern is useful in solving other linked list problems where in-place transformations are required without additional memory allocation.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:

- Problem 21: Merge Two Sorted Lists

- Problem 142: Linked List Cycle II
- Problem 234: Palindrome Linked List

These problems each require manipulating linked list pointers and understanding the structure of linked lists to solve problems in place. The two-pointer technique is particularly prevalent in problems such as detecting cycles, reversing lists, and merging lists, where a sequential scan of the list is combined with pointer manipulation to achieve the desired result."
87,"LeetCode problem number 87 is titled ""Scramble String."" Here's a detailed analysis of this problem:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of the same length, the problem asks whether `s2` is a scramble of `s1`. A scramble string is a string that is created by following a recursive process:

1. If a string consists of only one letter, that string is considered a scramble string.
2. For any string with more than one letter, we can split it into two non-empty parts at any position within the string.
3. Swap the two parts and then proceed to recursively scramble each part.

The problem essentially asks us to determine if `s2` can be arrived at by applying these rules to `s1`. It's important to note that you can swap the parts obtained after splitting the string at any time or even choose not to swap them at all, which must be considered when constructing the recursion.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To approach this problem, we can consider the recursive definition of a scramble string. The most intuitive solution is to apply a recursion by trying each possible split and swap, and then checking if the resulting scrambled parts match `s2`. To optimize this, we can use dynamic programming or memoization to avoid recomputing the result for the same substrings.

Moreover, before doing all of the recursive splits, we can apply a few checks:
1. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is obviously a scramble of `s1`.
2. If the sorted characters of `s1` don't match the sorted characters of `s2`, then `s2` cannot be a scramble of `s1` because all the letters and their counts must match for one string to be a scramble of another.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Here is a Python function that uses recursion with memoization to solve the problem:

```python
def isScramble(s1, s2):
    memo = {}

    def dfs(s1, s2):
        if (s1, s2) in memo:  # Check if the result is already computed
            return memo[(s1, s2)]

        if len(s1) != len(s2) or sorted(s1) != sorted(s2):  # Pruning
            return False

        if s1 == s2:  # If both substrings are equal, it's a scramble
            return True

        for i in range(1, len(s1)):
            # Split and check without swap and with swap
            if (dfs(s1[:i], s2[:i]) and dfs(s1[i:], s2[i:])) or (dfs(s1[:i], s2[-i:]) and dfs(s1[i:], s2[:-i])):
                memo[(s1, s2)] = True
                return True

        memo[(s1, s2)] = False
        return False

    return dfs(s1, s2)
```

- `isScramble` defines a nested function `dfs` which employs depth-first search to explore all possible split positions recursively.
- The `memo` dictionary is used to store the results of previously computed string pairs; this serves as a cache to improve the efficiency by avoiding recomputation.
- Inside `dfs`, if the result for a given pair `(s1, s2)` is already computed and stored in `memo`, it is returned immediately.
- The `if` statement checks for inequality in sorted versions of `s1` and `s2` or their lengths as a quick failure case.
- If `s1` and `s2` are equal, we return `True` since they are trivially scrambles of each other.
- The loop iterates over possible split positions `i` from 1 to `len(s1) - 1`, and recursively checks two situations for each split: without swapping the parts (`s1[:i]` with `s2[:i]` and `s1[i:]` with `s2[i:]`) and with swapping (`s1[:i]` with `s2[-i:]` and `s1[i:]` with `s2[:-i]`).
- If either of these recursive checks returns `True`, we memoize the result and return it.
- If none of the splits results in a scramble, we mark the pair `(s1, s2)` in `memo` as not scramble and return `False`.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's consider two examples:

- **Example 1**: `s1 = ""great""` and `s2 = ""rgeat""`.
  - ""great"" can be split into ""gr"" + ""eat"".
  - These parts can be scrambled to get ""rg"" + ""eat"".
  - Now, the second part ""eat"" can be split as ""e"" + ""at"" and scrambled to get ""ate"".
  - Combining these, we get ""rg"" + ""ate"" which equals ""rgeat"".
  - So, `s2` is indeed a scramble of `s1`.

- **Example 2**: `s1 = ""abcde""` and `s2 = ""caebd""`.
  - There's no way to split and scramble ""abcde"" to get ""caebd"".
  - Although ""abcde"" can be split many ways and the parts scrambled, none will result in ""caebd"".

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the naive recursive approach can be as bad as O(2^n) as at each step, we're making a decision whether to swap or not, and this decision is made recursively. However, with memoization, many calls are cached which significantly reduces the total number of states we have to compute. The total unique states can be approximately O(n^2), where n is the length of the strings.

The space complexity is O(n^3) due to three main factors:
1. The recursive call stack that can go as deep as the length of the strings (O(n)).
2. The `memo` dictionary can have at most O(n^2) keys because there are n possible starting points and n possible lengths for each substring.
3. Each key in `memo` is a tuple containing two strings, each at most the length of the input strings (O(n)), although this does not stack multiply as strings are immutable and can be re-used by reference.

### Real-World Applications

The scramble string problem is abstract but has real-world applications in areas like data cryptography and obfuscation, where data might be intentionally scrambled for purposes of security and later unscrambled using a key or algorithm. It also has implications in the field of genetics, where DNA sequences may undergo transformations that are biologically similar to the scrambling operation.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

A common pitfall is to attempt a brute-force recursive solution without memoization, which results in repeated calculations and a slower solution that might not complete within reasonable time limits.

One trick to optimize the problem is to include the pruning steps before diving into the recursion, which leads to early rejections of some recursive paths.

Another tip is to ensure that you consider all possible split positions within the strings and to check both the swapped and non-swapped cases at every recursion level.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The problem falls under the category of dynamic programming (involving overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure) and recursive problem solving. Recognizing when to apply memoization or dynamic programming is critical in optimizing recursive solutions for problems with overlapping subproblems like this one.

88,"LeetCode problem number 88 is titled ""Merge Sorted Array."" Here is a detailed explanation of the problem, along with a Python solution, complexity analysis, and more.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
In this problem, you are given two sorted integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, and two integers `m` and `n` representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively. The array `nums1` has a size that is large enough to hold additional elements from `nums2`.

The challenge is to merge `nums2` into `nums1`, so the resulting `nums1` array is sorted. The merged elements of `nums1` and `nums2` should overwrite the original elements of `nums1`.

Here are some constraints that are important to consider:
- You cannot use extra space (the solution has to be in-place).
- `nums1` has enough space (size equal to m + n) to hold the additional elements from `nums2`.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
The key to solving this problem is to take advantage of the fact that both arrays are already sorted. One straightforward way to do this problem would be to merge the two arrays and then sort the result, but that's not leveraging the information that `nums1` and `nums2` are sorted, and it's not optimal in terms of complexity.

Therefore, a more efficient approach is to fill the array `nums1` starting from the end, placing the greater elements first. This way, you can avoid overwriting elements that have not been checked yet. You begin comparison from the last element of `nums1`'s and `nums2`'s portions and work your way backwards.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
Here is how the algorithm can be implemented in Python, with an explanation for each key part:

```python
def merge(nums1, m, nums2, n):
    # Indices start at the last element of the respective parts
    p1, p2, p = m - 1, n - 1, m + n - 1
    
    # Continue merging until one of the arrays is exhausted
    while p1 >= 0 and p2 >= 0:
        if nums1[p1] > nums2[p2]:
            nums1[p] = nums1[p1]
            p1 -= 1
        else:
            nums1[p] = nums2[p2]
            p2 -= 1
        p -= 1
    
    # If there are any elements left in nums2, add them
    # No need to check for nums1, because nums1's elements are already in place
    nums1[:p2+1] = nums2[:p2+1]

# Example usage
nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0]
nums2 = [2, 5, 6]
merge(nums1, 3, nums2, 3)
```

1. `p1, p2, p` are pointers that keep track of the current index being compared/merged for `nums1`, `nums2`, and the position where the merged element should be placed, respectively.
2. The main loop continues as long as there are elements to compare in both arrays. At each iteration, it places the larger of the two elements being compared at index `p` and moves the respective pointers backward.
3. After the loop, if there remain any elements in `nums2` that haven't been merged (because they are smaller than any element in `nums1`), they are copied into the beginning of `nums1`.

### Elaborate Examples
Let's work through the example given in the code snippet to illustrate how the merging works:
```
nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0]
nums2 = [2, 5, 6]
m = 3, n = 3
```

- `p1` starts at index 2, `p2` starts at index 2, and `p` starts at index 5.
- The first comparison is between `nums1[2]` and `nums2[2]`. `nums1[2]` is `3` and `nums2[2]` is `6`. `6` is greater, so it goes at `nums1[5]`.
- This process continues, with the pointers moving backward after each step, until all elements have been merged.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of the solution is O(m + n), because in the worst case, you may need to compare and merge each element of both `nums1` and `nums2` exactly once.

The space complexity of the solution is O(1), which means constant space complexity. No additional space proportional to the input size is required since the merging is done in-place.

### Real-World Applications
This problem represents a classic example of merging datasets in a sorted order without using additional space. It could be relevant in situations where you have limited memory and need to integrate two sorted lists, such as merging logs from different sources by timestamp, where you're not allowed to load everything into memory. It exemplifies efficient in-place algorithms that are crucial for large data processing on resource-constrained systems.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks
A common pitfall is not accounting for the cases where elements of `nums1` or `nums2` are already in the correct place. For example, if all elements of `nums2` are greater than every element in `nums1`, you must avoid overwriting the start of `nums1` until it's certain that no more elements from `nums1` need to be compared.

One trick is to start merging from the end, which is a common technique for in-place array manipulation problems.

### Problem Pattern Identification
The key pattern in this problem is the ""two pointers"" approach, which is widely used in array manipulation problems, particularly when dealing with sorted arrays.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems

- LeetCode 75: Sort Colors
- LeetCode 977: Squares of a Sorted Array
- LeetCode 986: Interval List Intersections

In each of these problems, you would use a similar strategy of leveraging the sorted property of the lists or arrays to achieve efficient, often in-place, solutions. The skill of using two pointers to traverse arrays is invaluable in solving these types of challenges."
89,"LeetCode Problem 89 is titled ""Gray Code"". The problem is part of the algorithms category and is rated as a medium difficulty problem. Let's break down the problem statement, understand the concept of Gray code, and formulate a variety of strategies to solve the problem in Python.

### Problem Statement:

The Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit (also known as a binary reflected Gray code). 

Given a non-negative integer `n` representing the total number of bits in the code, the task is to print the sequence of Gray code. A Gray code sequence must begin with 0 and must cover all 2^n possible integer values.

For example, a Gray code sequence for `n = 2` would be `[0,1,3,2]` or `[0,2,3,1]`. Both are valid sequences since each adjacent pair of values differs by exactly one bit.

### Constraints:

- `0 <= n <= 16`

### Understanding Gray Code:

A Gray code sequence for `n` bits is a sequence of 2^n integers where:

- The first integer is 0.
- Each subsequent integer differs from the previous integer by exactly one bit.
- The sequence covers all 2^n unique binary configurations.

It's important to note that for an `n`-bit Gray code, there are multiple valid solutions, as the problem states that any permutation of the sequence that satisfies the requirements is acceptable.

### Solution Rationale:

One way to generate a Gray code sequence is to start with the base case where `n = 0`, which is a sequence `[0]`. As you increase `n`, you can build on the Gray code sequence for `n - 1` by reflecting the sequence, prefixing the original sequence with `0` and the reflected sequence with `1`, and concatenating them to form the new sequence.

### Python Code Explanation:

We could implement this recursively or iteratively. Here's how we could define a function to solve it recursively:

```python
def grayCode(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    else:
        prev_gray = grayCode(n-1)
        return prev_gray + [x + (1 << (n-1)) for x in reversed(prev_gray)]
```

Let's go through this code step by step:

1. Base Case: If `n` is `0`, we return the base case `[0]`.
2. Recursive Case: We calculate Gray code for `n-1` and store it in `prev_gray`.
3. The new sequence for Gray code of `n` is formed by taking `prev_gray` (prefixing these numbers with a `0` bit which does not change their value) and appending the reflected version of `prev_gray` with a `1` bit prefix. The `(1 << (n-1))` shifts a `1` to the correct place value to create the prefix.
4. The list comprehension `x + (1 << (n-1)) for x in reversed(prev_gray)` effectively adds `1` as the most significant bit to each number in the reversed `prev_gray`.

### Example:

Let's generate a Gray code sequence for `n = 2`:

1. For `n = 0`, the sequence is `[0]`.
2. For `n = 1`, we reflect `[0]` to get `[0]` again, prefix original with `0` to get `[0]` and prefix the reflection with `1` to get `[1]`. Concatenating these lists gets `[0, 1]`.
3. For `n = 2`, reflecting `[0, 1]` gives `[1, 0]`, prefixing with `0` gives `[00, 01]` (which is `[0, 1]` in decimal) and prefixing the reflection with `1` gives `[11, 10]` which is `[3, 2]` in decimal. Concatenating these lists gets `[0, 1, 3, 2]`.

### Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: O(2^n), as we are generating every possible configuration of n bits exactly once.
- Space Complexity: O(2^n), which is required for the output list.

### Real-World Applications:

Gray codes are used in various applications, for example:

- Position encoders, where the position is converted into a Gray code so that only one bit changes at a time, minimizing error.
- In error correction and digital communications, Gray codes can be used to prevent spurious output from transitions between states.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Ensure that the sequence starts with `0`.
- Understand that the problem expects a sequence of integers, not a list of binary strings.
- Be cautious with the bit manipulation when reversing and concatenating the Gray code sequences.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

The problem is a classic example of recursion and bit manipulation. Recognizing the pattern of the problem helps in solving similar problems that involve generating combinatorial objects based on certain constraints.

### Links to Similar Problems:

Some similar problems which involve recursion and/or bit manipulation include:

- LeetCode 78 (Subsets)

Understanding solutions to this problem can help you develop an approach to similar problems that require building solutions step-by-step while ensuring certain properties hold at each step."
90,"LeetCode Problem #90 is ""Subsets II."" Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the problem, followed by an in-depth explanation of the solution strategy, a detailed Python code explanation, examples, complexity analysis, real-world applications, common pitfalls and tricks, problem pattern identification, and links to similar problems.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

In the ""Subsets II"" problem, you are given an integer array `nums` that may contain duplicates. Your task is to return all possible subsets (the power set). The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets, and the subsets within the solution set must be returned in any order.

A subtle nuance of this problem as compared to the classic ""Subsets"" problem is the presence of duplicate elements in the input array. This means that simply generating all subsets would not suffice; we also need to ensure that duplicates within the power set are removed.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To generate all possible subsets, we can use a backtracking approach, which is a kind of depth-first search (DFS). Here's the typical strategy for generating subsets using backtracking:

1. Sort the input array to ensure that duplicates are adjacent, which makes it easier to skip over duplicates during the subset generation process.
2. Traverse the array, and for each element, choose to either include it in the current subset or exclude it.
3. Ensure that when we come across duplicates, we treat consecutive duplicate elements as a special case to avoid generating duplicate subsets.

Now, let's compare this with another method: iterative. In an iterative solution, we start with an empty list as the initial ""power set""; for each number in the input, we add it to each currently existing subset to create new subsets. However, because of duplicates in the input array, this method could generate duplicate sets, which we would then need to filter out, resulting in higher complexity and reduced efficiency.

The backtracking approach is preferred for its efficiency in dealing with duplicates â€” we can prune the search space and skip generating the duplicate subsets in the first place.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's dive into the Python code implementing the backtracking approach:

```python
def subsetsWithDup(nums):
    def backtrack(start, path):
        # Add the current subset to the result
        res.append(path[:])
        # Explore further elements to make new subsets
        for i in range(start, len(nums)):
            # Skip duplicates
            if i > start and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
                continue
            # Include the current element in the path and backtrack
            backtrack(i + 1, path + [nums[i]])

    nums.sort()  # Sort the array to handle duplicates
    res = []
    backtrack(0, [])
    return res
```

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

- `subsetsWithDup(nums)`: This function generates all subsets without duplicates.
- `def backtrack(start, path)`: A helper function that generates subsets. It uses recursion to explore all possibilities.
  - `res.append(path[:])`: This appends a copy of the current path (which represents a subset) to the result. We create a copy with `path[:]` because the path will change as we backtrack.
  - `for i in range(start, len(nums))`: We iterate through the elements starting from the `start` index.
  - `if i > start and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]`: This is the crucial step that handles duplicates. If the current element is the same as the previous one and it's not the starting element of this path, we skip it to prevent duplicate subsets.
  - `backtrack(i + 1, path + [nums[i]])`: This is the backtracking step where we recursively call the function to explore further elements.
- `nums.sort()`: We sort the input array before backtracking to make duplicate elements adjacent.
- `res = []`: Initialize a list to store the subsets.
- `backtrack(0, [])`: Start backtracking from index 0 with an empty path.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's illustrate the solution with an example:

Given `nums = [1, 2, 2]`, after sorting the array becomes `[1, 2, 2]`.

- We start with an empty path `[]`, which is a subset by itself, so we add it to `res`.
- Next, we include the first element `1`, making the path `[1]`. We add it to `res`.
- Then, we include the second element `2`, making the path `[1, 2]`. We add it to `res`.
- We attempt to include the third element, which is also `2`, making the path `[1, 2, 2]`, and add it to `res`.
- We backtrack and consider the subsets that include the second element `2` but not the first element `1`: so, we add `[2]` and `[2, 2]`.
- Finally, `res` contains `[[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 2], [2], [2, 2]]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the backtracking approach is O(2^N) in the worst case, where N is the number of elements in the input array. This is because each element has two choices: either it is included in the subset or not. However, due to the handling of duplicates, the actual time complexity will often be less since we skip over subsets that would have been duplicates.

The space complexity is O(N) for the recursion stack. Additionally, if we consider the space needed to store all subsets, it would be O(2^N * N) since there are 2^N subsets and each subset can take up to N space.

### Real-World Applications

This problem can be applied to situations where you need to enumerate all combinations of a set with potential repetitions, such as generating all possible search queries from a list of keywords where some keywords might be synonyms.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Forgetting to sort the nums array can lead to incorrect results because you won't be able to effectively skip duplicates.
- It's easy to forget making a copy of the path with `path[:]` when adding to the results. If you directly add the path object, since it's mutable, all entries in your result will end up being the same reference and hence have identical contents after the final iteration.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The pattern for this problem is backtracking, which is a DFS strategy used to generate all possible solutions to a problem and construct solutions incrementally.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems

Similar problems that also employ backtracking or involve generating combinations or permutations include:

- Subsets (LeetCode 78)
- Permutations (LeetCode 46)
- Permutations II (LeetCode 47)
- Combination Sum (LeetCode 39)
- Palindrome Partitioning (LeetCode 131)

All these problems can be solved using backtracking where you build a solution step by step and backtrack when you detect that the current path won't lead to a solution or after adding a solution to your result set."
91,"LeetCode problem number 91 is titled ""Decode Ways."" The problem is a medium-difficulty algorithmic challenge that focuses on dynamic programming. Here, I will provide an exhaustive breakdown of the problem, discuss solution strategies, explore a detailed Python code implementation, provide examples, analyze the time and space complexity, delve into real-world applications, outline common pitfalls and tricks, identify problem patterns, and offer links to similar problems.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The problem ""Decode Ways"" presents a string containing only digits and asks the number of ways it can be decoded to get a list of characters where 'A' to 'Z' correspond to '1' to '26'. The mapping of digits to letters is similar to how text messages were encoded on a numerical keypad in the days before smartphones.

The specific conditions of the problem are as follows:

- The input is a non-empty string only containing digits, and it should not contain any leading zeros.
- We need to count the number of ways to decode it into letters.
- The numbers '1' to '26' map to 'A' to 'Z'.
- The string can have a varying number of digits, so we must consider different lengths and their implications.

An empty string or a string with invalid decoding (like ""06"" which cannot be decoded because '0' doesn't map to any letter and '06' isn't a valid two-digit number in the encoding) should result in zero, as there is no way to decode it.

Some nuances to consider in this problem are:

- A single '0' can't be decoded by itself; it must be paired with a preceding '1' or '2' to make a valid '10' or '20' decoding.
- Any digit following a '0' must be considered the start of a new valid decoding (if possible).
- Consecutive valid two-digit numbers can be split into one-digit decodings or left as is.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The solution to this problem involves recognizing it as a dynamic programming challenge. Dynamic programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.

A typical approach to solve this problem is to use a bottom-up dynamic programming algorithm:

1. **Initialization:** Create a DP array of size n+1, where n is the length of the input string. The array is initialized such that `DP[0]` is 1 (an empty string has one way to be decoded), and `DP[1]` depends on whether the first character is a zero or not (if it's zero, then there are zero ways; otherwise, there's one way).

2. **State Transition:** To fill in the rest of the DP array, start from the second character and move rightwards:
   - For each index `i`, set `DP[i]` to `DP[i-1]` if the current character is not '0' (since a non-'0' can be decoded on its own).
   - If the two-digit number formed by the current and the previous character falls between 10 and 26 (inclusive), add `DP[i-2]` to `DP[i]`.
   - This addition reflects that a valid two-digit number can be considered a single letter, so it carries the number of ways that were possible until `i-2`.

3. **Result:** After filling in the array, `DP[n]` contains the number of ways to decode the entire string.

Here is a step-by-step example of how the algorithm would work on the input ""226"":

- `DP[0]` is 1.
- `DP[1]` is 1 because '2' can be decoded as 'B'.
- For `i=2`, '2' can be decoded as 'B', so `DP[2] = DP[1]`.
- Since '22' also can be decoded as 'V', we also add `DP[0]` to `DP[2]`, so `DP[2] = DP[1] + DP[0] = 2`.
- Now, for `i=3`, '6' can be decoded as 'F', so `DP[3] = DP[2]`.
- Since '26' is valid, we add `DP[1]` to `DP[3]`, so `DP[3] = DP[2] + DP[1] = 3`.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's implement the dynamic programming solution in Python:"
92,"LeetCode problem number 92 corresponds to ""Reverse Linked List II,"" which is a medium-difficulty problem. Below is a comprehensive guide to the problem, including an extensive breakdown, solution rationale, Python code explanation, examples, complexity analysis, real-world applications, common pitfalls and tricks, problem pattern identification, and related problems.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem statement for ""Reverse Linked List II"" can be summarized as follows:

Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers `left` and `right`, where `left <= right`, reverse the nodes of the list from position `left` to position `right` and return the modified list's head.

A singly linked list is defined as a sequence of nodes where each node points to the next node in the sequence, with the last node pointing to `None`. Each node has one data value and a pointer to the next node.

The `left` and `right` parameters specify the one-based positions (not zero-based indexing) indicating the start and end of the subsection of the linked list to be reversed. All other nodes outside of this range should remain in their original order.

For example, given a linked list `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5` and `left = 2`, `right = 4`, the resulting linked list after the operation should be `1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5`.

The subtle nuances in this problem include:
- Handling the cases where `left` is equal to `right` (in which case the list remains unchanged).
- Dealing with `left` being 1, meaning the head of the list itself may change.
- Ensuring that the connections between nodes both within and outside of the `left` to `right` range are properly maintained after the reversal.
- The linked list's size is not given; thus, we should consider the case when the list is shorter than `right`.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, the following steps outline the approach to take:

1. Identify the node just before the `left` position (which we can refer to as `prev_left`). This node's `next` pointer will eventually need to point to the `right` node after the reversal.
2. Reverse the sublist between `left` and `right`, keeping track of the new head of this reversed sublist (`new_head`) which will be the `right` node, and the tail (`sublist_tail`) which was initially the `left` node.
3. Connect the `prev_left` node's `next` pointer to `new_head`.
4. Connect the `sublist_tail` node's `next` pointer to the node immediately following the `right` node (which we can call `next_right`).
5. If `left` is 1, then the new head of the list is `new_head` â€“ otherwise, it remains as it was.

The Python code will revolve around iterating over the linked list to find the necessary nodes and then carrying out the reversal process.

The reason for preferring this approach is that it involves only a single pass through the linked list, which keeps the time complexity low. Although there are other methods one might consider, such as extracting the nodes to an array, reversing the array, and then rebuilding the list, this increases both the space and time complexity unnecessarily.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's write the Python code step by step to solve this problem:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def reverseBetween(head, left, right):
    # If left is the same as right, no need to reverse anything.
    if left == right:
        return head

    # Start with a dummy node to handle edge cases easily (like when left is 1).
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = head
    prev_left = dummy

    # Move `prev_left` just before the `left` node.
    for i in range(left - 1):
        prev_left = prev_left.next

    # Now, start the reversal process.
    sublist_tail = prev_left.next
    current = sublist_tail.next

    # Reverse the sublist.
    for i in range(right - left):
        temp = current.next
        current.next = prev_left.next
        prev_left.next = current
        sublist_tail.next = temp
        current = temp

    # If `left` was 1, the new head is prev_left.next, otherwise, head stays the same.
    new_head = dummy.next if left == 1 else head
    return new_head
```

In the above code, `ListNode` is the class representing a node in a singly linked list.

The function `reverseBetween` takes a linked list's `head` node and two integers, `left` and `right`. 

Firstly, a conditional check ensures that if `left` is equal to `right`, the list is returned as-is, as there is no need for reversal.

A dummy node is then introduced to simplify edge cases and to prevent extra checks for whether we're dealing with the head of the list. The dummy node's `next` is attached to the `head` of the actual list.

A for-loop moves the `prev_left` pointer to one position before the `left` node. This enables easy manipulation of the node that will eventually need to connect to the head of the reversed sublist.

The reversal process begins with taking the node immediately following `prev_left` as the tail of the sublist (`sublist_tail`). Then we iterate from `left` to `right`, reversing the pointers within this range.

After the reversal, we may need to update the `head` of the list if `left` was at position 1. This is determined by comparing `left` with 1 and setting the new `head` appropriately.

The function concludes by returning the new `head` of the possibly modified linked list.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's take the linked list `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`, with `left = 2` and `right = 4`:

1. The dummy node is set up, `prev_left` moves to node `1`.
2. The sublist to be reversed is `2 -> 3 -> 4`. 
3. Reversal of this sublist results in `4 -> 3 -> 2`.
4. The previous node of the sublist (`1`) is connected to `4`, and `2` (the new tail of the reversed sublist) is connected to `5`.
5. The final list is `1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5`.

Let's run this example through the code to see it in action.

```python
# Helper function to create a linked list from a list of values.
def create_linked_list(lst):
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    current = dummy
    for val in lst:
        current.next = ListNode(val)
        current = current.next
    return dummy.next

# Helper function to convert a linked list back to a Python list (for visualization).
def linked_list_to_list(head):
    lst = []
    current = head
    while current:
        lst.append(current.val)
        current = current.next
    return lst

# Example list and reverse operation
head = create_linked_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
left = 2
right = 4

reversed_list_head = reverseBetween(head, left, right)
result_list = linked_list_to_list(reversed_list_head)
print(result_list)
```

When executed, this code should print out the list `[1, 4, 3, 2, 5]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

The overall time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the list. This is because we traverse the list only once up to the `right` position, with constant-time operations performed per node along the way.

The space complexity is O(1) since the reversal is done in place, and aside from a fixed number of pointers, no additional space proportional to the size of the input is used.

### Real-World Applications:

The reversing of a linked list segment finds applications in areas such as:

- Text editors, where a sequence of actions/characters needs to be reversed to implement the undo feature.
- Data processing pipelines, where chunks of data may need to be reversed or processed in a different order.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

Common pitfalls include:

- Forgetting to handle the case when `left` is 1 which changes the head of the list.
- Mixing up the one-based indexing specified by the problem with Python's zero-based indexing.
- Losing track of the node after the `right` position, resulting in a severed list.

A handy trick for linked list problems is to use a dummy node to eliminate the need for special case handling at the beginning of the list. This simplifies the logic required to handle corner cases.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem is an instance of the in-place linked list manipulation problem pattern, where the goal is to rearrange the nodes without allocating additional nodes or using extra data structures.

93,"LeetCode Problem 93 is titled ""Restore IP Addresses."" Let's break down this problem in detail.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem asks us to find all possible valid IP address combinations that can be formed by inserting three dots into a given string containing only digits. An IP address consists of four parts, each part can have one to three digits, so we are essentially breaking the string into four parts, separated by dots.

The rules for a string being a valid IP address are as follows:
1. Each part can contain between 1 and 3 digits.
2. Each part must not have leading zeros, except for the number 0 itself.
3. Each part must be less than or equal to 255.

A string is not allowed to be split into parts at any locations other than those that form a valid IP address, and if adding a dot would lead to an invalid part, then that dot placement is skipped.

#### Example:
Given the string `""25525511135""`, one possible and valid IP address combination is `""255.255.11.135""`.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, a backtracking algorithm is suitable. Backtracking is a common approach for generating all possible combinations or permutations of a dataset. 

Here is the strategy for backtracking in this problem:
1. Create a recursive function that takes the input string, and also the current list of segments (each segment represents one part of the IP address) and the position at which we are currently looking.
2. If we have four valid segments and we are at the end of the string, we have found a valid combination, and we should add it to our list of results.
3. If we are not at the end of the string, nor do we have four segments, we try to create a new segment by taking one, two, or three digits from the string and appending them to our current list of segments.
4. Each time we take digits from a string to form a segment, we check if the new segment is a valid IP segment (it has to be an integer between 0 and 255, and not have leading zeros except for the number 0 itself).
5. If the segment is valid, we proceed to the next position in the string by recursing with our updated current segments and position. If it isn't, we skip adding the digit and backtrack.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's write the Python code.

```python
def restoreIpAddresses(s):
    def valid(segment):
        # Check if a segment is valid:
        # 1. less than or equal to 255
        # 2. no leading zeros
        return int(segment) <= 255 if segment[0] != '0' else len(segment) == 1

    def backtrack(prev_pos=-1, dots=3):
        # Use nonlocal to modify variables from the outer scope
        nonlocal segments, output

        # Iterate over the positions that are allowed for the current dot
        # the current segment ends at position pos - 1
        for pos in range(prev_pos + 1, min(len(s), prev_pos + 4)):
            segment = s[prev_pos + 1:pos + 1]
            if valid(segment):
                segments.append(segment)  # place dot
                if dots - 1 == 0:  # if all 3 dots have been placed
                    update_output(pos)  # add the configuration to the output list
                else:
                    backtrack(pos, dots - 1)  # continue to place dots
                segments.pop()  # remove the last placed dot

    def update_output(curr_pos):
        nonlocal segments, output
        segment = s[curr_pos + 1:len(s)]
        if valid(segment):
            output.append('.'.join(segments + [segment]))

    output = []
    segments = []
    backtrack()
    return output
```

Let's walk through this code, snippet by snippet.

1. `valid(segment)`: This is a helper function that checks if a provided segment is a valid part of an IP address, meaning that it follows the rules set above.

2. `backtrack(prev_pos=-1, dots=3)`: This is the main backtracking function. It takes the previous position where we placed a dot (initially set to -1 since we haven't started), and the number of dots remaining to place (`dots`). 

3. The for loop within `backtrack()`: This loop iterate over all possible placements of the next dot. We make a recursive call to place the rest of the dots if the segment we cut is valid by our criteria. 

4. `update_output(curr_pos)`: This helper function is called when all dots have been placed (no more dots to place), and adds the complete valid IP address to the output list, if the last segment is also valid.

5. `output = []` and `segments = []`: These are the lists we use to keep track of the final IP addresses and the current segments we're considering along the way.

6. The last call to `backtrack()` actually starts our backtracking process.

7. Finally, we return the list of output, which contains all reconstructed IP address combinations.

### Elaborate Examples:

Consider the string `""25525511135""` again.

1. In the first recursive call, we take `""2""` as the first segment and recursively call backtrack with this segment.
2. Then `""55""` as the second segment, and so on.
3. As we continue doing this, one of the valid IP addresses we will find is `""255.255.11.135""`. Since all segments meet our validity criteria, this is added to the output list.

Another example could be a string like `""010010""`, which would return `[""0.10.0.10"", ""0.100.1.0""]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

The backtracking algorithm will at most execute 3^(n-1) function calls, where n is the length of the input string S, because there are at most 3 different ways to continue with each step. However, this is the upper bound which doesn't take pruning into consideration.

In the best-case scenario, the complexity could be improved due to:
- Skipping the rest of the recursive calls when a valid IP address is found.
- Stopping the exploration of a branch when an invalid segment is generated, which happens often due to the nature of the constraints.

In the worst-case scenario, when we consider the recursion and the string manipulation (which adds its own complexity due to slicing), we could say that the time complexity is O(n * 3^n), and space complexity is O(n) (recursive call stack and segments list).

### Real-World Applications:

This algorithm could be used in network configuration software that needs to generate all possible IP addresses from some compact representation or when validating user input for IP addresses.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

Common pitfalls in this problem include not handling leading zeros correctly, and not checking the range of the numbers after conversion to integers (e.g., forgetting that IP address segments cannot be greater than 255).

A useful trick could be preprocessing the string to quickly discard cases that are obviously not valid, for example, if the string is less than 4 characters or more than 12, there is no need to proceed with the backtracking.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

The problem fits into the category of combinatorial search and/or backtracking problems. Recognizing this pattern is valuable for solving similar problems, which involve exploring a set of solutions that must satisfy certain constraints.

94,"LeetCode Problem 94 is titled ""Binary Tree Inorder Traversal."" Here's a comprehensive analysis and explanation of the problem.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown
The problem asks for the inorder traversal of a binary tree and to return the inorder traversal as a list. In binary trees, an inorder traversal is one of the most common depth-first traversal techniques where you follow the sequence:

1. Traverse the *left subtree* recursively inorder.
2. Visit the *root* node.
3. Traverse the *right subtree* recursively inorder.

In simple terms, for each node, you first explore its left subtree, then visit the node itself (often to process, or in this case to collect the value), and finally, you explore its right subtree. This process will output the values of the nodes in a binary tree in the ascending order if the binary tree is a binary search tree.

The binary tree nodes are defined as shown below:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

Each `TreeNode` has an integer value `val`, and pointers to its `left` and `right` children.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
The inorder traversal can be approached using either iterative or recursive methods:

#### Recursive Method
The recursive method is a straightforward implementation of the inorder traversal algorithm:
- If the current node is null, return (base case for the recursion).
- Recursively traverse the left subtree.
- Visit the current node (e.g., append the node's value to a result list).
- Recursively traverse the right subtree.

This solution is easy to understand, and closely mimics the definition of inorder traversal.

#### Iterative Method
The iterative method uses a stack to simulate the recursive calls. The main steps are:
- Create an empty stack to maintain the traversal state.
- Start with the root node and push all the left children onto the stack.
- While the stack is not empty, pop a node from the stack, visit it, and if the popped node has a right child, push the right child and all its left children onto the stack.

Both approaches achieve the same goal but in different manners. The recursive method relies on the function call stack to keep track of the nodes, while the iterative method manages the traversal state explicitly with a stack data structure.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
I will demonstrate both recursive and iterative solutions, starting with the recursive:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def inorderTraversal(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
        def _inorder(node):
            if not node:
                return []
            return _inorder(node.left) + [node.val] + _inorder(node.right)
        
        return _inorder(root)
```
In this recursive solution, `_inorder` is a helper function that carries out the inorder traversal. If the current node is null, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it makes recursive calls to itself for the left subtree, visits the current node by including its value in the list, and then makes a recursive call for the right subtree. These lists are concatenated with the `+` operator and returned.

Now, let's look at the iterative solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def inorderTraversal(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
        stack = []
        result = []
        current = root
        while current or stack:
            # Reach the leftmost node of the current node
            while current:
                stack.append(current)
                current = current.left
            # Current must be None at this point
            current = stack.pop()
            result.append(current.val)
            # We have visited the node and its left subtree.
            # Now, it's right subtree's turn.
            current = current.right
            
        return result
```
In this iterative solution, we use a stack to keep track of the nodes. We initialize `current` to start at the root and a `result` list to store the visited nodes. In the main `while` loop, we first traverse as far left as possible, pushing each node onto the stack. When there are no left children, we pop the top node from the stack, visit it by adding its value to the `result` list, and then proceed to its right child if it exists, repeating the process.

### Elaborate Examples
To better understand these solutions, let's walk through an example:

```
    1
     \
      2
     /
    3
```

For this tree, an inorder traversal would visit the nodes in the order `[1, 3, 2]`.

Let's go through the iterative method:

- Push 1 to the stack.
- Since 1 has no left child, we pop 1 and append it to the result: `result = [1]`.
- Move to the right child of 1, which is 2, and push 2 to the stack.
- 2 has a left child, 3, so push 3 to the stack.
- Since 3 has no children, pop 3 and append it to the result: `result = [1, 3]`.
- Move to the right child of 3, which is null, so continue to the next iteration of the loop.
- Pop 2 from the stack and append it to the result: `result = [1, 3, 2]`.
- Since all nodes are visited, the `while` loop terminates, and we return `result`.

The recursive method would entail the following steps:
- Call `_inorder(1)`
  - Traverse left (which is null)
  - Visit 1, which puts `1` in the list
  - Call `_inorder(2)`
    - Call `_inorder(3)`
      - Traverse left (which is null)
      - Visit 3, which puts `3` in the list
      - Traverse right (which is null)
    - Visit 2, which puts `2` in the list
  - Combining these lists, we get `[1, 3, 2]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
For both the iterative and recursive methods:

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because every node in the tree is visited exactly once.
- Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This reflects the worst-case space taken up by the call stack (for the recursive method) or the explicit stack (for the iterative method). In the worst case of an unbalanced tree, this could be O(n).

### Real-World Applications
Inorder traversal is not just a theoretical exercise; it has practical applications. For example, in binary search trees, an inorder traversal retrieves the elements in sorted order, which can be used to sort elements, verify the correctness of a BST, or implement iterators over a BST.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks
When implementing either solution, it's crucial to consider the following:
- Handle the edge case when the root is null.
- Understand the difference between visiting a node and traversing a subtree.
- For the iterative solution, ensure not to get stuck in an infinite loop by managing the current node correctly.

### Problem Pattern Identification
The pattern identified here is `Depth-first Traversal`, particularly `Inorder Traversal` of a binary tree. Recognizing this pattern can help to solve a variety of tree problems that require visiting each node in a specific order.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems
Similar problems to practice inorder traversal and other tree traversals on LeetCode include:
- Preorder Traversal (Problem 144)
- Postorder Traversal (Problem 145)
- Level Order Traversal (Problem 102)

Mastering these traversal techniques is essential for tackling more complex tree problems, as they lay the foundation for understanding tree algorithms."
95,"LeetCode Problem 95 is titled ""Unique Binary Search Trees II"". This problem deals with generating all structurally unique BSTs (Binary Search Trees) that store values 1...n. The challenge is to implement a function that returns a list of all these trees.

Here's an extensive breakdown of the problem:

### Problem Statement:

Given an integer `n`, we have to generate all structurally unique BSTs (binary search trees) that store the values `1` through `n` inclusively. 

### Understanding BST:

A BST is a tree data structure where each node follows the below rules:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

### Constraints:

- `0 <= n <= 8` - The value of `n` is limited, meaning a brute force solution could potentially be feasible due to the limited output size.

### Function Signature:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node:
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def generateTrees(self, n: int) -> List[TreeNode]:
```

The function `generateTrees` returns a list of TreeNode objects, each TreeNode object representing a unique BST.

### Understanding the Problem with Examples:

Let's consider `n = 3`. The unique BSTs that can be constructed with values from 1 to 3 are as follows:

1.   1         3     3      2      1
       \       /     /      / \      \
        3     2     1      1   3      2
       /     /       \                 \
      2     1         2                 3

That is, there are a total of 5 unique BSTs that can be constructed with nodes having values 1 to 3.

### Solution Strategy:

To find all unique BSTs, we'll have to consider each number `i` from `1` to `n` as the root, then recursively find all valid left and right subtrees using the numbers less than `i` and greater than `i`, respectively.

Here is a general approach to solve the problem:
1. If `n` is zero, we return an empty list, as there are no trees to construct.
2. We loop through each integer `i` from `1` to `n`:
    a. For each `i`, we recursively generate all possible left subtrees using values `1` to `i-1`.
    b. Similarly, we recursively generate all possible right subtrees using values `i+1` to `n`.
3. The current integer `i` will be the root node, and for each combination of left and right subtrees, we create a new root node and connect them.
4. We collect all such trees and return them.

### Python Code Explanation:

We will write a recursive function that returns a list of all subtrees formed with a specified range of numbers. This recursive function will serve as a helper to our main `generateTrees` function.

```python
def generateTrees(n):
    if n == 0:
        return []

    def generate_subtrees(start, end):
        if start > end:
            return [None]

        all_trees = []
        for i in range(start, end + 1):  # root
            # Generate all possible left and right subtrees
            left_trees = generate_subtrees(start, i - 1)
            right_trees = generate_subtrees(i + 1, end)

            # Connect left and right trees to the root i
            for l in left_trees:
                for r in right_trees:
                    root = TreeNode(i)
                    root.left = l
                    root.right = r
                    all_trees.append(root)

        return all_trees

    return generate_subtrees(1, n)
```

### Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: The time complexity is quite difficult to determine due to the nature of the recursion. It relies heavily on the number of unique trees (Catalan number), which can be expressed as C(n) = (1 / (n + 1)) * (2n choose n). The recursion generates all of these trees, resulting in an O(n * C(n)) time complexity.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is also governed by the number of unique trees C(n) since each tree is being stored in memory. Hence, the space complexity is also O(n * C(n)).

### Real-World Applications:

Generating unique BSTs can be useful in scenarios like testing databases, optimizing queries, or any application that requires an exhaustive search of states regarding ordered data. It could also serve as a foundation for understanding how decision trees in machine learning algorithms (such as Random Forests) are constructed and how different branching structures can affect the performance.

### Common Pitfalls:

- Overlooking the importance of generating trees using a range of values, rather than copying subtrees or using the same subtrees for multiple trees.
- Not considering `None` as a valid subtree, which is necessary to create leaf nodes.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

The pattern in this problem is a recursive DFS (Depth-First Search) pattern often used in tree construction problems dealing with permutations and combinations.

### Related LeetCode Problems:

- LeetCode Problem 96 ""Unique Binary Search Trees"": Similar to this problem but asks for the count of unique BSTs instead of the trees themselves.
- LeetCode Problem 98 ""Validate Binary Search Tree"": A problem that takes a constructed BST and asks whether it is valid.
- LeetCode Problem 108 ""Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree"": A problem where you construct a height-balanced BST given a sorted array.

This solution leverages recursive generation of subtrees, combining them in all possible ways, to create unique structures, capturing the essence of permutation-related tree construction problems."
96,"LeetCode Problem 96 is titled ""Unique Binary Search Trees."" Here is a detailed analysis of the problem:

## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, you have to determine the number of structurally unique BSTs (binary search trees) that store values 1 through `n`.

### Input
- An integer `n` (1 <= n <= 19).

### Output
- An integer representing the number of unique BSTs.

## Extensive Problem Breakdown

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree where each node has the following properties:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be BSTs.

We need to count the number of unique BST structures without actually constructing them. The problem does not concern itself with different node values but only the structure. Because the values from 1 to `n` are distinct and consequent, the structure of the tree is determined uniquely by the choice of root and the division of the remaining elements into the left and right subtrees.

## In-Depth Solution Rationale

### Approach: Dynamic Programming

The core idea here is to use dynamic programming to simplify the problem by breaking it into subproblems. We can use the fact that BSTs with `n` nodes are formed by choosing each number from 1 to `n` as the root, then recursively forming BSTs from the numbers below it and above it.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. Initialize an array `dp` of size `n+1` to zero, where `dp[i]` will store the number of unique BSTs that can be made with `i` nodes.
2. Set a base case: `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`. Zero nodes can form an empty tree, and there is only one unique BST with a single node.
3. Begin a loop from 2 to `n` as `i`, where `i` represents the number of nodes in the tree.
4. For each `i`, you must consider each integer `j` from 1 to `i` as the root node.
5. Calculate the number of unique left subtrees (which is `dp[j - 1]`) and the number of unique right subtrees (which is `dp[i - j]`).
6. The number of unique BSTs with `i` nodes and `j` as the root is the product of the number of unique left and right subtrees.
7. Sum the counts for all possible roots `j` to get `dp[i]`.
8. Finally, `dp[n]` will contain the total count of unique BSTs that can be formed with `n` nodes.

**Here's why dynamic programming fits this problem:** 

- **Overlapping Subproblems:** When building BSTs with `n` nodes, we encounter the same subtree sizes repeatedly. Once we know the number of BSTs that can be formed with `k` nodes, we don't have to recompute it.
- **Optimal Substructure:** The solution to a larger BST problem relies on the solutions to the smaller BST subproblems.

The Catalan Number sequence closely relates to the number of unique BSTs that can be formed with `n` nodes, and the dynamic programming approach essentially calculates these numbers.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation

Here's a Python implementation of the above approach:

```python
def numTrees(n):
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0], dp[1] = 1, 1

    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, i + 1):
            dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j]
    
    return dp[n]
```

- `dp = [0] * (n + 1)`: Initialize a list to store the number of unique BSTs for each `i` nodes. We need `n + 1` entries because we are including 0 nodes.
- `dp[0], dp[1] = 1, 1`: Set the base cases for 0 and 1 node.
- The outer loop `for i in range(2, n + 1):` considers trees of size `i`.
- The inner loop `for j in range(1, i + 1):` iterates over each number `j` to consider it as the root node.
- `dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j]`: Accumulate the count for `i` nodes by multiplying the count of unique BSTs to the left and right of `j`.
- `return dp[n]`: After the loops, `dp[n]` will contain the number of unique BSTs that can be formed with `n` nodes.

## Elaborate Examples

Let's consider how the algorithm works for `n = 3`:

1. `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` are initialized to 1.
2. For `i = 2`, we have two options for the root: `1` or `2`. For each case, we have `dp[1] * dp[0]` or `dp[0] * dp[1]`, adding to `2`.
3. For `i = 3`, the roots can be `1`, `2`, or `3`.
   - With `1` as the root, we have `dp[0] * dp[2]` (since there are 2 nodes on the right)
   - With `2` as the root, we have `dp[1] * dp[1]`
   - With `3` as the root, we have `dp[2] * dp[0]` (since there are 2 nodes on the left)
   The sum is `dp[3] = 5`.

Thus, `numTrees(3)` returns `5`.

## Thorough Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2), since we have two nested loops, with the outer loop running 'n' times, and the inner loop potentially also running 'n' times for each iteration of the outer loop.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), as we only need an array of size `n+1` to store our intermediate results.

## Real-World Applications

The problem of counting unique BSTs has theoretical significance in combinatorics and can be applied to various areas like:
- Compiler theory, where the number of different abstract syntax trees for expressions can be determined.
- Understanding possible ways of organizing hierarchical data, which can be important in database indexing.

## Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Failing to set the correct base cases can lead to an incorrect number of BSTs.
- Forgetting that the number of unique trees is a product of the number of trees to the left and right of a chosen root is a common pitfall. It is not a sum or an average.

## Problem Pattern Identification

This problem is a classic example of dynamic programming, relying on previously calculated subproblems to solve larger problems. It also involves the usage of the Catalan Number concept, which is a common pattern in problems related to tree counting or parenthesis combinations.

## Extensive Links to Similar Problems

Problems related to counting unique trees or structures often employ dynamic programming and have a core relation to the Catalan numbers. Here are a few similar LeetCode problems:
- #95 - Unique Binary Search Trees II
- #22 - Generate Parentheses
- #241 - Different Ways to Add Parentheses

In all these problems, identifying the pattern of using dynamic programming and calculating results based on subproblem solutions is key to finding an efficient algorithm."
97,"LeetCode Problem #97 is known as the ""Interleaving String"" problem. Let's break down this problem in extensive detail.

### Problem Statement

Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, find whether `s3` is formed by an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`.

An interleaving of two strings `s1` and `s2` is a configuration where they are divided into non-empty substrings such that:

```
s3 = s1[0] + s2[0] + s1[1] + s2[1] + ... + s1[i] + s2[j] + ...
```

The interleaving maintains the relative ordering of characters within `s1` and `s2`.

#### Constraints
- `0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
- `0 <= s3.length <= 200`
- `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` consist of lowercase English letters.

#### Examples

Example 1:
```
Input: s1 = ""aabcc"", s2 = ""dbbca"", s3 = ""aadbbcbcac""
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s1 = ""aabcc"", s2 = ""dbbca"", s3 = ""aadbbbaccc""
Output: false
```

Example 3:
```
Input: s1 = """", s2 = """", s3 = """"
Output: true
```

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, we need a strategy that can handle the recursive nature of interleaving. A recursive solution would be to check, at each step, if the next character in `s3` can be formed by either taking the next character from `s1` or `s2`. However, due to overlapping subproblems and the recursive nature, this approach can quickly blow up in terms of time complexity.

Hence, a better approach is to use dynamic programming. The idea is to construct a 2D matrix `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents whether the first `i` characters of `s1` and the first `j` characters of `s2` can form the first `i + j` characters of `s3`. 

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

We can use the following approach to build the `dp` matrix:

1. Initialize the matrix with the size `(len(s1) + 1) x (len(s2) + 1)`, and set `dp[0][0]` to `True` because an empty `s1` and `s2` can always form an empty `s3`.

2. Fill the first row of the `dp` matrix. `dp[0][j]` should be `True` if `dp[0][j-1]` is `True` and `s2[j-1] == s3[j-1]`.

3. Similarly, fill the first column. `dp[i][0]` should be `True` if `dp[i-1][0]` is `True` and `s1[i-1] == s3[i-1]`.

4. Fill the rest of the `dp` matrix using the following rule: `dp[i][j]` is `True` if either `(dp[i-1][j] is True and s1[i-1] == s3[i+j-1])` or `(dp[i][j-1] is True and s2[j-1] == s3[i+j-1])`.

5. Finally, return the value of `dp[len(s1)][len(s2)]`.

Here is the Python code implementing this strategy:

```python
def isInterleave(s1, s2, s3):
    if len(s1) + len(s2) != len(s3):
        return False
    
    dp = [[False] * (len(s2) + 1) for _ in range(len(s1) + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = True
    
    for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] and s1[i - 1] == s3[i - 1]
    
    for j in range(1, len(s2) + 1):
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] and s2[j - 1] == s3[j - 1]
    
    for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):
        for j in range(1, len(s2) + 1):
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] and s1[i - 1] == s3[i + j - 1]) or (dp[i][j - 1] and s2[j - 1] == s3[i + j - 1])
    
    return dp[len(s1)][len(s2)]
```

### Elaborate Examples

Let's walk through the Example 2:

```python
s1 = ""aabcc"", s2 = ""dbbca"", s3 = ""aadbbbaccc""
```

After initializing, our `dp` matrix looks like this:

```
dp = [[True, False, False, False, False, False],
      [False, False, False, False, False, False],
      [False, False, False, False, False, False],
      [False, False, False, False, False, False],
      [False, False, False, False, False, False],
      [False, False, False, False, False, False]]
```

After filling the first row and column based on the characters matching `s3`, we get:

```
dp = [[True, False, False, False, False, False],
      [True, False, False, False, False, False],
      [True, True, True, False, False, False],
      [False, True, True, True, False, False],
      [False, False, True, True, True, False],
      [False, False, False, True, True, False]]
```

Now, we cannot just fill the next element because `s1[3] != s3[4]` and `s2[2] != s3[5]`. So `dp[3][2]` remains `False`. Following this process, we eventually learn that `s1` and `s2` cannot interleave to form `s3`, because `dp[5][5]` is `False`.

### Complexity Analysis

- *Time Complexity:* The algorithm runs in `O(n * m)` time, where `n` is the length of `s1` and `m` is the length of `s2`. This is because we need to compute the result for each of the `nm` entries in our 2D `dp` matrix exactly once.

- *Space Complexity:* The space complexity is also `O(n * m)` due to the 2D `dp` matrix that we construct.

### Real-World Applications

The ""Interleaving String"" problem and its solution techniques have real-world applications in scenarios that involve synchronization, merging streams of data without losing the sequence from individual streams (like interleaving video and audio packets), and checking whether a sequence can be obtained by merging two other sequences while preserving their original order (i.e., for data reconciliation).

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

Common pitfalls in this problem include:
- Not handling edge cases, such as one or both input strings being empty.
- Incorrectly initializing the `dp` matrix, which can lead to invalid outcomes.
- Not checking for the total length of `s1` and `s2` against `s3` at the beginning, which can lead to unnecessary computation.

Tricks to keep in mind:
- Use a boolean 2D array for the dynamic programming approach, as we're only interested in whether an interleaving is possible (True/False).
- Leveraging the fact that if `dp[i][j]` is True, the next True value can only be either in the same row or same column, not both.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem follows the dynamic programming pattern, specifically the 2D dynamic programming type, which is widely used in string manipulation problems that involve matching or interleaving sequences.

Learning how to solve ""Interleaving String"" provides a foundation for tackling other dynamic programming problems, especially those related to string processing. The concept of building up solutions by combining the results of smaller subproblems is a recurring theme across many dynamic programming challenges."
98,"The LeetCode problem number 98 is titled ""Validate Binary Search Tree (BST)"". The problem statement is as follows:

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
  
### Extensive Problem Breakdown
When approaching this problem, we need to thoroughly understand the properties of a binary search tree:
1. Every node's left subtree contains values strictly less than the node's value.
2. Every node's right subtree contains values strictly greater than the node's value.
3. Both the left and right subtree each must also be a valid binary search tree.

This recursive definition of a BST is central to validating whether a given binary tree meets the criteria. The problem can be tricky because it is not enough to check these conditions only for the immediate children of any node. Each subtree must be checked thoroughly, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied throughout the tree.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
There are a few methods to determine if a binary tree is a valid BST which we can consider:

1. **In-Order Traversal:** By performing an in-order traversal (left-root-right) on a BST, we should obtain a list of values in ascending order. If at any point this order is violated, we can conclude that the tree is not a valid BST.

2. **Recursive Traversal with Range Checking:** This involves recursively checking each subtree. For each node, check if the node's value falls within a valid range (initially negative infinity to positive infinity). When traversing left, the upper bound becomes the current node's value, and when traversing right, the lower bound becomes the current node's value.

3. **Iterative Traversal:** An iterative approach using a stack that simulates the in-order traversal can also be used to validate a BST.

The recursive method with range checking is often preferred because it is efficient and quite intuitive once understood. It checks every node only once and uses the BST properties effectively.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
Here's an example of how a recursive solution could be implemented in Python:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def isValidBST(root, left=float('-inf'), right=float('inf')):
    if not root:
        return True
    if not (left < root.val < right):
        return False
    # Recursively validate the left and right subtree
    return (isValidBST(root.left, left, root.val) and
            isValidBST(root.right, root.val, right))

# Usage
root = TreeNode(2, TreeNode(1), TreeNode(3))
print(isValidBST(root))  # True
```

In this code:

- The `isValidBST` function checks whether the tree rooted at `root` is a valid BST within the range defined by `left` and `right`.
- Initially, the allowed range is from negative to positive infinity.
- For each node, compare its value to the allowed range. If the node's value does not fall within this range, return `False`.
- Recursively call `isValidBST` on the left subtree, updating the upper bound to the current node's value.
- Recursively call `isValidBST` on the right subtree, updating the lower bound to the current node's value.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's consider the following example:

Given a binary tree like this:

```
    2
   / \
  1   3
```
- The call to `isValidBST` with root node 2 will check if `1 < 2 < inf`. This is true, so it will proceed to check the subtrees.
- The recursive call to `isValidBST` with root node 1 will check if `-inf < 1 < 2`. This is true, and since node 1 has no children, the left subtree is valid.
- The recursive call to `isValidBST` with root node 3 will check if `2 < 3 < inf`. This is true, and since node 3 has no children, the right subtree is valid.
- The tree is determined to be a valid BST.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the function `isValidBST` is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node in the tree is visited exactly once during the traversal.

The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This reflects the maximum size of the call stack during the recursive calls. In the worst case (a degenerate tree), the space complexity can become O(N), while in the best case scenario (a balanced tree), the space complexity is O(log N).

### Real-World Applications

Validating binary search trees has practical relevance in various applications such as database indexing, where elements are stored in a BST to allow for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

Common pitfalls include not considering the entire subtree when validating a node. It's essential to compare every subtree rather than just a node's immediate children. This can trip people up if they forget the recursive nature of BSTs.

A useful trick is to consider range checking, setting a valid interval every time you move left or right, rather than just comparing with immediate children.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The problem of validating a BST is generally categorized under the tree traversal and recursion patterns. Recognizing such a pattern makes it easier to approach other tree-related problems.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems

Here are a few LeetCode problems that are related to BST validation and involve tree traversal or recursion:

- ""Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree"" (LeetCode problem number 108)
- ""Kth Smallest Element in a BST"" (LeetCode problem number 230)
- ""Binary Tree Inorder Traversal"" (LeetCode problem number 94)
- ""Recover a Binary Search Tree"" (LeetCode problem number 99)

Each of these problems involves understanding the traversal of a tree or the properties of a BST, and the strategic pattern of recursion plays a major role in their solutions."
99,"LeetCode Problem #99 is titled ""Recover Binary Search Tree."" In this problem, you are given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST) where exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. The challenge is to recover the tree without changing its structure.

### Problem Statement Overview:

Let's define what a Binary Search Tree (BST) is: it is a tree where for each node, all nodes to its left have smaller values, and all nodes to its right have larger values. The problem implies that two nodes in this tree have been swapped, which causes the property of the BST to be violated.

Your goal is to find these two nodes and swap them back to correct the BST. The condition is that you must do this with the original tree structure intact, meaning that you cannot construct a new tree but rather must change the values in the existing nodes.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

The most straightforward method to identify the swapped nodes would be to do an in-order traversal of the BST. An in-order traversal of a correctly structured BST will yield the elements in sorted (ascending) order. If two nodes have been swapped, their values will be out of order in this traversal.

During the in-order traversal, we should find two pairs of consecutive nodes where the first node is larger than the second. In case these nodes are adjacent in the traversal, there will only be one such pair; otherwise, there will be two such pairs.

Once we identify the nodes that are out of order, we need to swap their values. Here's the high-level approach for the algorithm:

1. Perform an in-order traversal and keep track of the elements as you visit them.
2. Identify the nodes that are out of their proper order.
3. Swap the values of the identified nodes.

This problem can be solved using either iterative or recursive in-order traversal. We will discuss the recursive approach, which is often more straightforward to understand.

### Python Code Explanation:

Below is a Python function that can solve this problem using recursion:

```python
def recoverTree(root):
    # These pointers will be used to keep track of the swapped nodes
    first = second = None
    prev = TreeNode(float('-inf'))
    
    # Helper function to perform in-order traversal
    def inorder(node):
        nonlocal first, second, prev
        if not node:
            return
        
        # Visit left subtree
        inorder(node.left)
        
        # Find the first and second nodes that are out of order
        if prev.val > node.val:
            if not first:
                first = prev
            second = node
        
        # Update the previous node visited
        prev = node
        
        # Visit right subtree
        inorder(node.right)
        
    inorder(root)
    
    # Swap the values of the first and second node
    first.val, second.val = second.val, first.val
```

Let's break down the code:

1. We declare two pointers `first` and `second` to track the nodes that need to be swapped. `prev` points to the last node visited in the in-order traversal.
2. The helper function `inorder` performs an in-order traversal of the tree.
3. In the traversal, we compare the value of the current node with the `prev` node. If `prev.val > node.val`, it means the order is incorrect.
4. If 'first' is not already set, we set it to the previous ('prev') node, because this is the first time we've encountered a decrease in the value as we traverse. The current node is a candidate for the 'second' node, which might be the one swapped with 'first'.
5. We then set the `prev` to the current node each time, ensuring we're always comparing a node with its immediate predecessor in the in-order sequence.
6. After traversal, we swap the values of `first` and `second`, effectively recovering the tree.

### Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once during the in-order traversal.

The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree. In the worst case, the height of the tree is N (the tree is a linked list), and in the best case, it is log(N) (the tree is balanced). This space is used by the call stack due to recursion. For a balanced tree, this space complexity can be considered O(logN).

### Real-World Applications:

This problem mimics real-world scenarios where a data structure is compromised due to a couple of erroneous elements, and the goal is to identify and fix it without a complete rebuild â€” similar to correcting a database or file system corruption involving specific records or entries.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Forgetting to update the `prev` node during traversal can lead to incorrect identification of swapped nodes.
- It's essential to handle the edge case where the swapped nodes are adjacent in the in-order traversal.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

The solution to this problem primarily involves an in-order traversal of a binary tree. This pattern is common in tree manipulation and searching problems, as it provides a way to process nodes in a sorted order based on their values.

### Links to Similar Problems:

Please note that the exact solution and code may vary depending on conditions and constraints specific to each problem. Nonetheless, familiarizing oneself with tree traversal algorithms will prove beneficial in solving a wide array of related challenges on LeetCode and in practical applications."
100,"LeetCode Problem #100 is titled ""Same Tree"". Here, I'll provide a detailed breakdown of the problem, an in-depth analysis and explanation of the solution, including its complexities, and finally a comprehensive overview with examples.

### Problem Breakdown
The task in this problem is to determine if two binary trees are the same. Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

Here are some key points to consider about the problem statement:
- The definition of a binary tree is presumed knowledge for this problem.
- A tree is a data structure composed of nodes.
- Each node contains a value and pointers to its left and right children.
- The same tree means exactly the same structure and node values.

In other terms, to solve this problem, you need to make sure that corresponding nodes in both trees are present (i.e., neither is null) and hold the same value. This verification must be true for all nodes across the entire structure of both trees.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
The natural way to approach this problem is to perform a traversal on both trees simultaneously and compare the nodes as you go. Depth-first traversal, and more specifically a pre-order traversal (node-left-right), works well for this because it allows us to compare each node before we look at its children.

### Recursive Approach
The recursive approach involves checking if the current nodes are the same and then recursively checking the left and right subtrees. The base cases for the recursion will be:
- If both nodes are `None`, we return `True` because two null trees are considered the same.
- If one node is `None` and the other isn't, or if the nodes have different values, we return `False`.
- Otherwise, we check if the left subtree of both nodes is the same and if the right subtree of both nodes is the same.

This is a straightforward use of recursion that relies on the call stack to manage the comparisons of the tree.

### Iterative Approach
An iterative approach can be used as an alternative to recursion. This typically involves using a stack or queue to maintain the nodes to be compared. At each step, we would pull nodes from the stack/queue and compare them, pushing their children onto the stack/queue if the nodes are themselves the same.


### Python Code Explanation
Let's focus on the recursive solution as it is more intuitive and requires less code. Here is what the Python code might look like:
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def isSameTree(p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> bool:
    # If both nodes are None, they are the same.
    if not p and not q:
        return True
    # If one of the nodes is None or values are different, trees are not the same.
    if not p or not q or p.val != q.val:
        return False
    # Recursively check the left and the right subtree.
    return isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node in both trees is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(log(N))` in the best case (completely balanced tree) and `O(N)` in the worst case (completely unbalanced tree, where `N` is the height of the tree). This space is used by the recursion stack. For a balanced tree, the height is `log(N)`, and for a completely unbalanced tree, the height is `N`.

### Examples
Let's look at an example to see how this algorithm functions:
1. Given: Two trees, both are empty (`None`). Output: `True` because both trees are the same, obviously.
2. Given: `p` is a single node tree with the value `1`, and `q` is also a single-node tree with the value `1`. Output: `True` because both have the same structure and node value.
3. Given: `p` is a tree with the structure `[1, 2]` and `q` has `[1, null, 2]`. Output: `False`, because even though the node values are the same, the structure differs.

### Real-World Applications
- Similarity detection between data structures, important for diff tools, merge operations, or synchronization tasks.
- Checking unit test outputs when the output is tree-based data.
  
### Common Pitfalls and Tips
- Recursive solutions can hit recursion depth limits if the tree is very deep. To handle extremely large trees, an iterative solution may be necessary.
- It is easy to forget one of the base cases, especially checking for one tree being null while the other is not.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem demonstrates a common pattern in tree traversal problems: pre-order traversal and recursive structure. Recognizing the recursive nature of tree-based problems frequently leads to elegant and efficient solutions.
