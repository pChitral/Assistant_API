101,"LeetCode Problem 101 is titled ""Symmetric Tree"" and is classified under the Trees category. The problem tests your understanding of tree data structures, recursive and iterative algorithms, and symmetry concepts.

### Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree `[1,2,2,3,4,4,3]` is symmetric:

```
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
```

But the following `[1,2,2,null,3,null,3]` is not:

```
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
```

Note:

- You may solve the problem either recursively or iteratively.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

This problem presents a binary tree and requires us to determine if the tree is symmetric about its center. In other words, the left subtree of any node should be a mirror reflection of the right subtree of the same node.

When we talk about the mirror symmetry of a binary tree, we're referring to the following traits:

1. The left subtree is a mirror reflection of the right subtree of the root.
2. For any two nodes, one in the left subtree and one in the right subtree, their child nodes should follow a specific pattern:
   - The left child of the left node must be a mirror reflection of the right child of the right node.
   - The right child of the left node must be a mirror reflection of the left child of the right node.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The symmetry of a tree can be checked using two main approaches:

1. **Recursive Approach:**
   In the recursive approach, we define a helper function that takes two nodes as input and then checks for the following conditions:
   - Both nodes are `None`, in which case the subtree continues to be symmetric.
   - One node is `None` and the other is not, in which case symmetry is broken, and we return `False`.
   - Values of both nodes are equal, and then we recursively call the function on the cross-paired children, i.e., check if the left child of the left node is symmetrical to the right child of the right node and vice versa.

2. **Iterative Approach:**
   The iterative approach often employs a queue or stack data structure to perform level-order traversal. Two nodes are checked at each step for symmetry, and their children are inserted into the queue in a cross-pair order.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's first start with the **recursive approach**:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        def isMirror(t1: TreeNode, t2: TreeNode) -> bool:
            if not t1 and not t2:
                return True
            if not t1 or not t2:
                return False
            return (t1.val == t2.val) and isMirror(t1.left, t2.right) and isMirror(t1.right, t2.left)

        return isMirror(root, root)
```

In the above code, we define a helper function `isMirror` within the `isSymmetric` function. This helper takes two nodes as inputs (`t1` and `t2`) and returns `True` if they are symmetric. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

`isMirror` checks the base case where both nodes are `None`, indicating we've reached the end of the tree symmetrically. If one node is `None` and the other is not, then it breaks the symmetry, returning `False`. If both nodes are present, it checks whether the values are equal and then makes recursive calls to `isMirror(t1.left, t2.right)` and `isMirror(t1.right, t2.left)`, verifying that corresponding children are also symmetric.

And here is the **iterative approach**:

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        queue = deque([(root, root)])
        while queue:
            t1, t2 = queue.popleft()
            if not t1 and not t2:
                continue
            if not t1 or not t2:
                return False
            if t1.val != t2.val:
                return False
            queue.append((t1.left, t2.right))
            queue.append((t1.right, t2.left))
        return True
```

In the iterative version, we use a `deque` from the `collections` module, which allows efficient popping from the left end. We initialize the queue with a tuple that contains the root twice (since we compare the tree with itself). We then enter a while loop that continues as long as the queue is not empty. At each iteration, we pop a pair from the queue and apply similar checks as we did in the recursive approach.

If the values of the nodes differ, we immediately return `False`. If the values match, we append the children to the queue in cross-pair order, ensuring that on subsequent iterations, the mirroring nodes are compared.

### Examples

Let's consider a simple example of a symmetric tree:

```
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
```

In both recursive and iterative solutions, the helper function or queue will initially compare the root with itself and then the children in the cross-paired order to confirm symmetry. For instance, `2` on the left with `2` on the right, and then `3` on the left with `3` on the right, and so on. If all comparisons are successful, the method will return `True`.

### Complexity Analysis

For both recursive and iterative solutions: 

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` - where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node in the tree is visited once.

- **Space Complexity:** In the recursive approach, space complexity is `O(h)`, where `h` is the height of the tree, because of the recursion stack (which can be `O(n)` in the worst case of a skewed tree but is `O(log(n))` if the tree is balanced). For the iterative approach, space complexity is also `O(h)` due to the queue storing at most the maximum number of nodes at any level, which corresponds to the width of the tree.

### Real-World Applications

The concept of symmetry is used in various real-world applications including, but not limited to, computer graphics for reflection operations, data structures for designing efficient algorithms for palindromic sequences, and even in robotics (for path planning with symmetrical paths).

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

A common pitfall could be ignoring the case where the tree root is `None`, which should also return `True`. Moreover, not considering the mirrored order of children could result in incorrect comparisons.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem falls under the pattern of tree traversal and comparison. Recognizing the pattern of mirrored recursive calls can greatly aid in solving similar problems that involve comparison or symmetry.

102,"LeetCode Problem #102 is titled ""Binary Tree Level Order Traversal."" It is a classic problem in the domain of binary tree traversal and it is classified under the category of 'Breadth-first Search' in the LeetCode problem set. Let's dive into each aspect of this problem.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem statement gives us a binary tree and asks us to return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. This means we need to traverse the tree level by level, starting from the root, moving to the nodes at the second level (the children of the root), and so on until we reach the leaves.

A binary tree is a data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. For the level order traversal, also known as breadth-first traversal, we should visit all the nodes at the current level before moving on to the next level.

Level order traversal is typically implemented using a queue data structure. This is because a queue enables us to process nodes in the order they were added, which aligns with the level-order traversal requirement.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

Since this is a traversal problem and we need to process nodes level by level, the natural choice is to use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.This is typically done using a queue.

Here is the basic strategy for a BFS approach to solve this problem:

1. Initialize a queue and insert the root node of the binary tree into it.
2. While the queue is not empty, perform the following steps:
   - Determine the number of nodes at the current level (this is the queue's size at the beginning of the level).
   - Create an empty list to hold the node values for the current level.
   - For each node at this level, remove it from the queue, add its value to the level list, and then add its left and right children (if they exist) to the queue for processing at the next level.
3. After processing all nodes at the current level, add the level list to the output list.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the queue becomes empty, indicating that all levels have been processed.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's implement the solution:

```python
from collections import deque

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def levelOrder(root: TreeNode):
    if not root:
        return []
    
    result = []
    queue = deque([root])
    
    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)
        level_nodes = []
        
        for _ in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            level_nodes.append(node.val)
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
        
        result.append(level_nodes)
    
    return result
```

- We import `deque` from `collections` as it is an efficient queue implementation in Python.
- We have our `TreeNode` class which is the standard way binary trees are represented.
- Our `levelOrder` function first checks if the tree is empty (`if not root:`) and returns an empty list if that's the case.
- It initializes the result list and the queue containing just the root node.
- The `while` loop continues until there are no more nodes to process in the queue.
- The `level_size` is calculated to ensure we only process the nodes belonging to the current level during each iteration.
- We extract the first node from the queue, add its value to `level_nodes`, and if it has children, we add those to the queue.
- At the end of the loop, we add the values of all nodes at the current level to the result.
- Finally, we return the result.

### Elaborate Examples:

Consider the following binary tree:

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

Our level order traversal would look like this:

```
[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because every node is processed exactly once.

The space complexity is also O(n). In the worst case, the queue will hold all the nodes at the level with the maximum number of nodes. This happens when the tree is perfectly balanced and the bottom level is fully filled and, in this case, the last level contains n/2 nodes.

### Real-World Applications:

The level order traversal is a foundational concept used in various real-world applications such as:
- Hierarchical data processing, where tasks might depend on levels within an organization or process flow.
- In networking, breadth-first search algorithms are used while broadcasting to all nodes in the network, like in peer-to-peer protocols.
- In artificial intelligence and machine learning, especially in decision tree algorithms where data points are evaluated level by level.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

One common pitfall is not accounting for the varying number of nodes at each level – this is where tracking the `level_size` comes into play.

A trick commonly used is to toggle between using `deque.popleft()` and `deque.append()` to maintain the correct order of node traversal without needing to reverse lists.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem follows the pattern of Breadth-First Search (BFS) in a tree. Recognizing this pattern helps you realize that a queue is likely the right data structure to use.

103,"LeetCode problem 103 is titled ""Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal"". Let's break down this problem in detail to understand what is being asked and then proceed to provide a detailed solution strategy.

### Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

More formally, the problem defines a binary tree and expects us to traverse it level by level, but with a twist: we alternate the direction of traversal with each new level. In one level, we would move from left to right, while in the next, we would move from right to left, and so on.

To better understand the task, let’s assume a binary tree looks like this:

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

The expected zigzag level order traversal would be:

```
[
  [3],
  [20,9],
  [15,7]
]
```

### Nuances and Constraints

- The tree's node count will be in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

These constraints provide us with a scope for our solution, ensuring it must handle potentially large trees but with limited value ranges.

### Solution Strategy

Here is a high-level outline of an approach to solve this problem:

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Since we need to process nodes level by level, Breadth-First Search is suitable here. We will use a queue to process all nodes at the current level before moving on to the next.

2. **Direction Alternation**: Maintain a flag that keeps track of the current direction of reading node values. Alternating the flag with each level will let us switch between left to right and right to left.

3. **Level Collection**: Collect all node values at each level. If the current level is from right to left, we can either reverse the collected values before adding them to the final result or use a deque to append elements from the left or right accordingly.

### Python Code Explanation

Here is how the Python code may look like:

```python
from collections import deque

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def zigzagLevelOrder(root: TreeNode):
    if not root:
        return []
    
    result, queue, left_to_right = [], deque([root]), True
    
    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)
        level_nodes = deque()
        
        for _ in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            
            if left_to_right:
                level_nodes.append(node.val)
            else:
                level_nodes.appendleft(node.val)
            
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
        
        result.append(list(level_nodes))
        left_to_right = not left_to_right
    
    return result
```

**Detailing each part of the code:**

- We define a `TreeNode` class to represent each node of the binary tree.
- The function `zigzagLevelOrder` takes the root of a binary tree as its argument.
- We use a queue (`deque`) to store the nodes of the current level to be processed.
- The `left_to_right` flag helps us know the current traversal direction.
- Inside the loop, we create a new `level_nodes` deque where we'll append the nodes' values according to the current direction.
- We iterate through all nodes at the current level (based on `level_size`), processing them, and adding their children (left and right if present) to `queue` for the next level.
- Depending on the `left_to_right` flag, we append the nodes' values to `level_nodes`.
- After processing all nodes at one level, we append `level_nodes` to `result` and switch the `left_to_right` flag.
- Finally, once we've traversed all levels, we return the `result`.

### Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity**: O(n) - where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is processed exactly once.

**Space Complexity**: O(n) - even though we're using a deque, which can store at most the width of the tree (which is O(n) in the worst case), the space taken for the `result` list is also O(n). The overall complexity combines to O(n).

### Real-World Applications

The zigzag level order traversal can find applications in areas where we have hierarchical data and require some form of alternate processing at each level. Examples may include organizational structures, tree-based graphic rendering, and AI algorithms for games or decision-making processes that mirror hierarchical options.

### Common Pitfalls and Tips

- It's crucial to correctly maintain the `left_to_right` flag, as failing to invert it at each level will lead to an incorrect result.
- The user must remember to use a double-ended queue (`deque`) as it allows appending and popping from both ends efficiently.
- Forgetting to check if the left or right child exists before adding them to the queue will result in an error.

### Problem Pattern

This problem is a variant of the typical breadth-first search tree traversal, with an additional condition about the order of traversal. Recognizing these types of problems helps you apply BFS with slight modifications to achieve the desired output.

104,"LeetCode Problem 104 is titled ""Maximum Depth of Binary Tree."" This problem is classified as an easy problem in the Tree and Depth-First Search (DFS) categories. Let's break down the problem's details, discuss solution strategies, dive into a Python code explanation, go through examples, analyze complexities, talk about real-world applications, outline potential pitfalls, identify problem-solving patterns, and finally, look at related problems.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The problem statement asks you to find the maximum depth of a binary tree. The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node. A leaf is a node with no children.

The binary tree is represented by root nodes of the TreeNode class, defined as follows:
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
```
You will be given the root of a binary tree and are expected to return an integer that represents its maximum depth.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
To solve this problem, you can use either an iterative or a recursive approach. Recursive solutions are often cleaner and more intuitive for tree-based problems such as this one.

1. **Recursive Approach (DFS):**
   - If the node is `None`, you return `0` since it represents an empty tree.
   - Otherwise, recursively compute the depth of the left and right subtrees.
   - The depth of the current node is `1` (for the node itself) plus the maximum of the depths of the left and right subtrees.
   
2. **Iterative Approach (BFS or DFS using stacks/queues):**
   - You could also use a breadth-first search (BFS) that employs a queue to traverse the tree level by level, incrementing a count each time you complete a level.
   - Alternatively, a stack can be used to emulate the recursive DFS.

The recursive approach is the most commonly seen for this problem as it maps elegantly onto the binary tree structure.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Below is the recursive DFS solution:
```python
def maxDepth(root):
    if not root:
        return 0
    else:
        left_depth = maxDepth(root.left)
        right_depth = maxDepth(root.right)
        return max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1
```
- If `root` is `None`, then `0` is returned, which is our base case.
- If `root` is not `None`, the function calls itself for the left and right children of the current node, getting their respective depths.
- Finally, it takes the maximum of the left and right depths and adds `1` (which accounts for the current node), and returns that value.

### Elaborate Examples:
Consider this binary tree:
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
The maximum depth would be 3 (root node 3, right child 20, and right grandchild 7).

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Every node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** In the worst case (completely unbalanced tree), the recursion stack can grow to O(N). In the best case (completely balanced tree), the height of the tree would be log(N), resulting in a space complexity of O(log(N)).

### Real-World Applications:
Understanding the maximum depth of trees can help in scenarios where logical hierarchies are involved, such as organizational charts, file directory structures, or more complex data structures in computer science like decision trees in machine learning.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- A common pitfall is forgetting to add `1` when calculating the maximum of left and right depths, which corresponds to the current node's depth.
- Another pitfall is not handling the base case properly when the node is `None`.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem is a classic example of the Divide and Conquer pattern, where the problem for a tree is reduced to subproblems for its left and right subtrees.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:
- LeetCode Problem 111 - ""Minimum Depth of Binary Tree"": Similar to this problem but asks for the minimum depth instead of the maximum.
- LeetCode Problem 543 - ""Diameter of Binary Tree"": Instead of depth, this problem asks for the diameter, which is the longest path between any two nodes in a tree.
- LeetCode Problem 226 - ""Invert Binary Tree"": This problem involves modifying the tree directly rather than calculating a property like depth.

Each of these related problems requires a slightly different tree traversal approach and understanding of tree properties but leverages similar recursive problem-solving patterns."
105,"LeetCode Problem 105 is titled ""Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal"". Let's go through the problem statement, and then I will break it down in detail before we move on to the solution.

Problem Statement:
Given two integer arrays `preorder` and `inorder` where `preorder` is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and `inorder` is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.

Understanding the Problem:
To understand this problem, you should be familiar with the concept of tree traversal. In a binary tree, each node contains a value, and up to two children (left and right). The preorder traversal of a binary tree is a depth-first traversal where the current node is processed before the left and right children. The inorder traversal processes the left child, then the current node, and finally the right child.

In this problem, you're given two lists:
- `preorder`: A list of integers representing the order in which nodes are visited in a preorder traversal of the tree.
- `inorder`: A list of integers representing the order in which nodes are visited in an inorder traversal of the same tree.

Your task is to use these two lists to reconstruct the original binary tree. The binary tree is guaranteed to have unique values for nodes, meaning there will be no duplicates, which assures a single unique solution to the problem.

Here are the nuances in the problem:
1. Both `preorder` and `inorder` arrays are of the same length.
2. Every value in the `preorder` array is unique.
3. Every value in the `inorder` array is unique.
4. The `preorder` and `inorder` arrays represent the traversal order of the same binary tree.

Solution Strategy:
To solve this problem, one should be acquainted with how the preorder and inorder traversal orders relate to the tree structure. Specifically, remember these key facts:
- The first element in the `preorder` list is the root of the binary tree.
- The `inorder` list contains the left subtree's nodes before the root's value and the right subtree's nodes after the root's value.

Using these facts, we can design a recursive algorithm to construct the binary tree:

1. Pop the first value from the `preorder` list; this is the root node.
2. Find this root node's value in the `inorder` list. The nodes to its left in the `inorder` list make up the left subtree, and the nodes to its right make up the right subtree.
3. Recur for the left subtree with the corresponding `inorder` subrange.
4. Recur for the right subtree with the corresponding `inorder` subrange.
5. Stop recursion when no elements are left for the subtree in the `inorder` subrange.

One potential optimization is to use a hashmap to store the indices of the elements in the `inorder` list, so we can quickly find the root in the `inorder` array without the need to search through it each time.

We will implement this strategy and analyze its time and space complexity after we discuss the code in detail.

Complexity Analysis:
When we work through the solution, we will analyze the time complexity, which is often O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, because we visit each node exactly once. The space complexity is also O(n) to account for the space used in the recursion stack and the hashmap that we may use for node lookups.

Now let's proceed to code the solution and analyze it in detail."
106,"LeetCode Problem 106 is titled ""Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal"". This problem requires you to reconstruct a binary tree given two arrays that represent the inorder and postorder traversals of the tree.

Here's the statement of the problem:

Given two integer arrays `inorder` and `postorder` where `inorder` is the inorder traversal of a binary tree and `postorder` is the postorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= inorder.length <= 3000`
- `postorder.length == inorder.length`
- `-3000 <= inorder[i], postorder[i] <= 3000`
- `inorder` and `postorder` consist of unique values.
- Each value of `postorder` also appears in `inorder`.
- `inorder` is guaranteed to be the inorder traversal of the tree.
- `postorder` is guaranteed to be the postorder traversal of the tree.

**Problem Analysis:**
To understand this problem, we need to be familiar with the concepts of binary trees and tree traversal methods, particularly inorder and postorder traversals.
- In an **inorder traversal**, you visit the left subtree, the root node, and finally the right subtree.
- In a **postorder traversal**, you visit the left subtree, the right subtree, and finally the root node.

The key observation for this problem is that the last element in the postorder traversal is always the root of the tree. With this in mind, we can find this root element in the inorder array, which would divide the inorder array into left and right subtrees. By knowing how many elements are there in the left subtree, we can divide the postorder array into left and right subtrees as well (note that the postorder array does not include the root anymore, as it's been identified).

Repeatedly applying this process recursively to the left and right subtrees, we can construct the binary tree.

**Solution Rationale:**
The algorithm can be written in a recursive manner:
1. If the postorder array is empty, return `None` because we are at a leaf's null child.
2. Pop the last element from the postorder array. This is the root of the current subtree.
3. Find the index of this root in the inorder array. This index will separate the inorder list into elements belonging to the left and right subtrees.
4. Recursively construct the right subtree and then the left subtree by slicing the inorder and postorder arrays accordingly to represent the respective subtrees.
5. Create a tree node with the root value.
6. Assign the recursively constructed left and right subtrees to the root's left and right pointers, respectively.
7. Return the root node.

Note: The order of recursion matters. Since we pop the last element from postorder to find the root, and in postorder, left subtree comes before right subtree, we must build the right subtree first after finding the root.

**Python Code Explanation:**
Let's create the Python solution which will implement the above-mentioned strategy. We need to first define the TreeNode class that represents a node in the binary tree as per the problem specifications. Then we will write the main function to solve the problem.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def buildTree(inorder, postorder):
    # Base case: if there are no elements in postorder, we cannot form a tree
    if not postorder:
        return None
    
    # The last element of postorder will always be the root of (sub)tree
    root_value = postorder.pop()
    root = TreeNode(root_value)
    
    # Find the root index in inorder list which will separate the list into left and right subtrees
    inorder_root_index = inorder.index(root_value)
    
    # Recursively build the right subtree and then the left subtree
    # This is because we build the tree from the postorder's end to start
    root.right = buildTree(inorder[inorder_root_index+1:], postorder)
    root.left = buildTree(inorder[:inorder_root_index], postorder)
    
    # Finally, return the constructed tree's root
    return root
```

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because, for each node, we search for its index in the `inorder` array. If the tree is highly unbalanced, we would need to search almost the entire `inorder` array for each node.
- Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is required for the recursive call stack. In the case of a skewed tree (like a linked list), the recursion depth could be n, and hence, the stack space will also be O(n).

However, if we precompute a hashmap to store the indices of values in the inorder array, we can improve the time complexity to O(n), since the root index lookup will be reduced from O(n) to O(1) for each recursive call. The space complexity due to the hashmap will also be O(n), in addition to the space required for the recursive call stack.

**Real-World Applications:**
Reconstructing trees from traversal data is analogous to reconstructing hierarchical structures from certain sequential or fragmented datasets, which is a common task in computational biology for phylogenetic tree reconstruction, in data recovery for file directory structures, and in UI development for recreating visual component trees.

**Common Pitfalls and Tips:**
- Accidentally constructing the left subtree before the right subtree could result in the wrong tree or consuming more elements than required for the left subtree.
- It is crucial to use the `pop()` function to remove the last element in the `postorder` array when determining the root.
- Avoid making copies of the array for each recursive call as that can increase both time and space complexity. Instead, use indices to process slices of the existing arrays in-place (if implementing an optimization with hashmap).

**Problem Pattern Identification:**
This problem falls under the pattern of ""Binary Tree Construction from Traversal Sequences,"" where you're asked to build a tree from given traversal sequences such as inorder, preorder, or postorder.

**Similar LeetCode Problems:**

- 889. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Postorder Traversal
- 1008. Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal

These problems, as well as Problem 106, require an understanding of tree traversal sequences and the relationship between them for the construction of trees.

Let's go ahead and implement this Python function with the additional optimization involving the hashmap to store the inorder indices."
107,"LeetCode Problem 107 is titled ""Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II"". This problem revolves around the binary tree data structure and requires you to perform a reverse level order traversal.

## Extensive Problem Breakdown

In this problem, you are given a binary tree and you are asked to return its bottom-up level order traversal as an array (known as a list in Python). This means that, unlike a regular level order traversal where you would return the nodes at each level from top to bottom, here you must return them from bottom to top.

A binary tree is a tree data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. A level order traversal of a binary tree is a breadth-first traversal where you visit all nodes at each level of the tree before moving on to the next level.

Here are the specific requirements and nuances of the problem:

- The binary tree may consist of zero or more nodes.
- The root of the tree is at level 1, its children are at level 2, and so on.
- The output should be a list of lists, where each sublist contains nodes at a particular level of the tree, with the sublists themselves ordered from the last level to the first level.
- The nodes within each level should be listed from left to right.

## In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, we can use a queue to help perform a regular level order traversal (breadth-first search) and then reverse the entire structure at the end, or we can insert each level at the beginning of our output list to simulate a reverse level order.

Here's a step-by-step solution using a queue:

1. If the root is `None`, return an empty list immediately since there are no nodes to traverse.
2. Initialize an empty list that will hold your level order traversal.
3. Initialize a queue (typically a `collections.deque` in Python for efficient popping from the front) and enqueue the root node of the tree.
4. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Determine the number of nodes at the current level (the queue's length at this point).
   b. Create a temporary list to hold the nodes at this level.
   c. For each node at the current level:
      - Dequeue the node from the queue.
      - Add the node's value to the temporary list.
      - If the node has a left child, enqueue it.
      - If the node has a right child, enqueue it.
   d. Append the temporary list to the front of the level order traversal result.
5. After the loop, return the result list.

This approach visits each node once and utilizes a queue to keep track of the nodes at each level.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation

Here's the Python code based on the rationale above:

```python
from collections import deque

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def levelOrderBottom(root):
    if not root:
        return []

    result = []
    queue = deque([root])

    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)
        level_nodes = []

        for i in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            level_nodes.append(node.val)
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)

        result.insert(0, level_nodes)  # Insert the level at the beginning of the result

    return result
```

Each part of this code snippet serves the following function:

- Import `deque` from `collections` for efficient append and popleft operations.
- The `TreeNode` class is a basic structure to represent nodes in a binary tree.
- The `levelOrderBottom` function performs the level order traversal in reverse.
- We first check if the `root` is `None`, in which case we immediately return an empty list.
- The `result` list will accumulate the nodes' values at each level in reverse order. 
- The `queue` is initialized with the root node.
- The `while` loop runs as long as there are nodes to process in the queue.
- `level_size` is used to iterate over all nodes at the current level.
- `level_nodes` temporarily stores the nodes' values at the current level.
- The `for` loop iterates over nodes at the current level, enqueuing their children for the next level.
- The `popleft` operation on the queue efficiently removes the first element.
- The `insert(0, level_nodes)` operation inserts the list of nodes at the current level to the beginning of `result`, maintaining a bottom-up order.

## Elaborate Examples

Let's take the following binary tree as an example:

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

The traditional level order traversal (top-down) is: `[[3], [9, 20], [15, 7]]`

Applying our code will result in the reverse order: `[[15, 7], [9, 20], [3]]`

## Thorough Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: The function has to visit every node exactly once, which gives us a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. It doesn't matter if the tree is balanced or not because every node needs to be visited.

Space Complexity: The auxiliary space used is for the queue, which can hold at most the width of the tree at its maximum level. In a worst-case scenario (a full binary tree), the maximum width is n/2 for a tree with n nodes, giving us a space complexity of O(n).

Real-World Applications: This problem demonstrates a traversal pattern that can be used in scenarios where tasks must be processed in a hierarchical manner but starting from the lowest dependency level up to the top-most dependency level. It is useful in scenarios such as dependency resolution, task scheduling, and more.

Common Pitfalls and Tricks: A common oversight might be to traverse the tree and then reverse the entire order to achieve bottom-up level order traversal. This works but can lead to unnecessary operations. Inserting each level's result at the beginning of the list is more efficient.

Problem Pattern Identification: This problem is a classic example of Breadth-First Search (BFS) in a binary tree, with a twist in the order of the output.

108,"Problem number 108 on LeetCode is titled ""Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree"". The problem statement is as follows:

Given an integer array `nums` where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree (BST).

A height-balanced binary tree is a tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

#### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem requires you to take a sorted array and construct a BST from it, such that the resulting BST is height-balanced. The key aspects of this problem that we need to understand are:

1. **Binary Search Tree**: A BST is a binary tree where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child, and satisfies the BST property: for any node `N`, all nodes in the left subtree of `N` have values less than `N`'s value, and all nodes in the right subtree have values greater than `N`'s value.

2. **Height-Balanced**: A binary tree is said to be height-balanced if for any node in the tree, the height of the left and right subtrees differs by at most one. The height of a subtree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

3. **Sorted Array**: The input is a sorted array, which simplifies the process of constructing the BST because you don't have to search for the correct position for each element—it's already given by the order in the array.

4. **Construction**: You must build the BST from the bottom up, ensuring that it is height-balanced. This involves finding the middle of the array (which will be the root of the BST or a subtree), and recursively applying this strategy to the left and right halves of the array to form the left and right subtrees, respectively.

#### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, we need to utilize a recursive approach. Here are the steps:

1. Identify the base case, which is when the current part of the array has no elements left.
2. Find the middle of the current part of the array to ensure the left and right subtrees have an equal (or as close to equal as possible) number of nodes.
3. Create a tree node with the value of the middle element.
4. Recursively perform the same operation on the left half of the array to create the left subtree.
5. Recursively perform the same operation on the right half of the array to create the right subtree.
6. Set the left and right children of the current node to the roots of the left and right subtree, respectively.

The reason we choose the middle element as the root (or the root of any subtree) is to keep the tree height-balanced. A recursive approach naturally lends itself to this problem because it mimics the way we would construct a BST manually: Start with the root, then create the left and right subtrees, and so on.

#### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Here's how the recursive function might look in Python:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def sortedArrayToBST(nums):
    if not nums:
        return None

    mid = len(nums) // 2
    root = TreeNode(nums[mid])
    root.left = sortedArrayToBST(nums[:mid])
    root.right = sortedArrayToBST(nums[mid + 1:])

    return root
```

Let's break down the code:

- We define a `TreeNode` class that represents a node in a BST, having a `val`, `left`, and `right`.
- In the `sortedArrayToBST` function, we first handle the base case: if `nums` is empty, we return `None`, which represents an empty tree.
- We find the middle index of the array using `len(nums) // 2`. Using integer division ensures that we get a whole number, even if the length of `nums` is even. In the case of an even length, the ""middle"" element will be the one on the right of the middle point.
- We create a `TreeNode` with the value of the middle element.
- We recursively call `sortedArrayToBST` for the left half (`nums[:mid]`) and right half (`nums[mid + 1:]`) of the array. These calls will return the root nodes of the left and right subtrees, respectively.
- We assign these to `root.left` and `root.right`, and finally, we return the `root` node.

#### Elaborate Examples:

Let's go through an example:

Given `nums = [-10, -3, 0, 5, 9]`, our function would proceed as follows:

1. The middle of the array is `0`, which becomes the root of the BST.
2. The left subtree is built from `[-10, -3]`: The middle is `-3`, which becomes the left child of the root.
3. The left subtree of `-3` is built from `[-10]`: Since there is only one element, it becomes the left child of `-3`.
4. There is no right subtree for `-3` because there are no elements left on the right side of `-10`.
5. The right subtree is built from `[5, 9]`: The middle is `9`, which becomes the right child of the root.
6. The left subtree of `9` is built from `[5]`: Since there is only one element, it becomes the left child of `9`.
7. There is no right subtree for `9` as there are no elements left.

Thus, the final BST structure would be:

```
        0
       / \
     -3   9
     /   /
  -10   5
```

#### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

Time complexity:
- The function visits each element once when creating nodes, which gives us O(N) time complexity, where N is the number of elements in the input array.
- It's important to note that slicing the array as done in `nums[:mid]` and `nums[mid + 1:]` can add additional time complexity since slicing is O(k) where k is the length of the slice. However, in some Python implementations, this can be considered O(1) due to the way memory is handled.

Space complexity:
- O(N) for storing the created BST.
- O(log N) for the recursive call stack, since the tree is height balanced.

#### Real-World Applications:

Understanding how to construct a balanced BST from a sorted array is not only a common interview question but also has practical uses in the real world. For instance, a BST can be used for efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions of data. Having a balanced BST ensures that these operations can be done in O(log N) time, which significantly improves performance for large datasets.

#### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

Some common pitfalls and tips to watch out for in this problem:

1. Remember the base case for the recursion to avoid infinite recursion.
2. When selecting the middle element, make sure you're moving to a different part of the array in each recursive call to prevent overlapping ranges.
3. Be mindful of slicing costs, you could pass array bounds instead to avoid extra costs and modify the function signature accordingly.

#### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem falls within the pattern of ""divide and conquer"". Recognizing that a large problem (like converting an entire array into a BST) can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem (forming left and right subtrees) is key to solving it efficiently.

#### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:

109,"LeetCode problem number 109 is titled ""Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree."" Let's delve into the various aspects of this problem:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The given problem involves converting a singly linked list that is sorted in ascending order into a height-balanced binary search tree (BST). A height-balanced BST is one where the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than 1. The individual nodes of the linked list correspond to the values within the nodes of the resulting BST.

**Key Concepts**:
1. **Singly Linked List**: A data structure where each element has a value and a pointer to the next element.
2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where the left child of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node’s value, and the right child only nodes with values greater than the node's value.
3. **Height-Balanced**: For any given node in the tree, the difference in heights of the left subtree and the right subtree is at most 1.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, we must keep in mind two crucial constraints:
1. The structure of the binary search tree must adhere to BST properties.
2. The tree must be height-balanced.

Here are a few strategies to convert the sorted list to a BST:

**Approach 1: Recursion with Array Conversion**
- Convert the linked list to an array. This allows us to access elements by index, which is useful for constructing the BST.
- Use a recursive approach to build the BST: Use the middle element as the root, recursively build the left subtree from the left subarray, and build the right subtree from the right subarray.
- Ensure the tree remains height-balanced by always choosing the middle element around which to center the subtree.

**Approach 2: In-Order Simulation**
- Since the linked list is sorted, we can simulate the in-order traversal. We know in-order traversal on a BST visits the nodes in ascending order.
- Recursively simulate the in-order traversal. Find the size of the list, and start constructing the left subtree with the first half of the elements, root with the middle element, followed by the right subtree with the remaining elements.

Approach 2 is generally more efficient as it does not require extra storage for array conversion.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Here is the Python code for approach 2 that simulates in-order traversal to build the BST:

```python
class Solution:
    def sortedListToBST(self, head):
        # This function finds the size of the linked list.
        def findSize(head):
            ptr = head
            size = 0
            while ptr:
                ptr = ptr.next
                size += 1
            return size
        
        # This recursive function will build the BST.
        def convertListToBST(left, right):
            nonlocal head
            # Base case when the pointers have crossed each other.
            if left > right:
                return None
            
            # Recursively build the left subtree.
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            left_child = convertListToBST(left, mid - 1)
            
            # Once left subtree is built, use the next node as the root.
            root = TreeNode(head.val)
            root.left = left_child
            
            # Move the head pointer to the next node.
            head = head.next
            
            # Recursively build the right subtree.
            root.right = convertListToBST(mid + 1, right)
            
            return root
        
        # We find the size and initiate the recursive function to build BST.
        size = findSize(head)
        return convertListToBST(0, size - 1)
```

Let's break down the code:
- `findSize` function iterates through the linked list to determine its size.
- `convertListToBST` is a recursive function that builds the BST. It uses the size of the list to determine the midpoint and recursively calls itself to build the left and right subtrees.
- `head` is updated each time we place a value in the BST to simulate in-order traversal, as `head` will keep pointing to the next node to be placed.
- Finally, the function `sortedListToBST` finds the size of the list and kicks off the recursive process.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's walk through an example where the linked list is `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`.

- The size of the list is 5.
- `convertListToBST` is called with `left = 0` and `right = 4`.
- `mid` is `2`, so node with value `3` becomes the root.
- Left subtree is built with `left = 0` and `right = mid - 1 = 1`. The midpoint of this is `0`, so node with value `1` becomes the left child.
- That subtree's right child is the next midpoint, `2` (`mid - 1 + 1`), so node with value `2` becomes the right child of node `1`.
- We then construct the right subtree of root `3`, recursively applying the same logic.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. We visit each node once.
- Space complexity: O(log N) due to the recursion stack during the construction of the BST.

### Real-World Applications

This problem demonstrates the transformation of one data structure into another, preserving the sorted order and balancing constraints. Such transformations are useful in optimizing search operations in applications like databases, filesystems, and any system where efficient data retrieval is crucial.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Mistakenly not updating the head of the linked list can lead to a wrong tree structure or infinite recursion.
- Not handling the base case in recursion can lead to stack overflow errors.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The pattern here is a divide-and-conquer approach where we divide the problem into subproblems and solve them recursively. Recognizing this pattern can help solve similar problems, such as constructing trees from sequences or arrays.

110,"LeetCode problem number 110 is ""Balanced Binary Tree."" In this problem, you're given a binary tree and you must determine if the tree is height-balanced. A binary tree is considered height-balanced if, for every node, the heights of the left and right subtrees never differ by more than one.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
In more detail, the problem states:
- You are given the root of a binary tree.
- You need to ensure that for every node in the tree, the depth of the left subtree and the depth of the right subtree differ by no more than 1.
- If the tree satisfies this condition, the function should return `True`. If the tree does not satisfy this condition at any node, the function should return `False`.

A binary tree node is typically defined as:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
To solve this problem, you can use a recursive approach that works its way up from the leaf nodes to the root:

1. The base case of the recursion is when you reach a `None` leaf node. Here, the height is 0.
2. For each node, you recursively compute the height of its left and right subtrees.
3. If the difference in heights is more than 1, you can immediately conclude that the tree is not balanced. You could throw an exception or use a global variable to record that the tree is unbalanced.
4. If the tree is balanced up to the current node, return the height of the current node, which is `1 + max(height of left subtree, height of right subtree)`.
5. When the recursion unwinds, it will ultimately return whether the tree is balanced and what the height of the tree is (though the height is relevant only if the tree is balanced).

A common optimization is to short-circuit the recursion if you find that the tree is not balanced so that you do not continue to compute heights for other branches of the tree unnecessarily.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Here's one way the solution could look in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        def checkBalanced(node):
            if not node:
                return 0
            leftHeight = checkBalanced(node.left)
            if leftHeight == -1: return -1  # Short-circuiting if left subtree is unbalanced
            rightHeight = checkBalanced(node.right)
            if rightHeight == -1: return -1  # Short-circuiting if right subtree is unbalanced
            
            if abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1:
                return -1  # Returning -1 if the current node is unbalanced
            return max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1
        
        return checkBalanced(root) != -1
```

In this code:
- The nested `checkBalanced` function is a recursive helper function that returns the height of the subtree rooted at the given node if it is balanced; otherwise, it returns `-1` to indicate that the tree is not balanced.
- The check for unbalance is done via the `abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1` condition. If this condition is true, `-1` is returned up the call stack.
- By returning `-1` when a subtree is unbalanced, we ensure that further recursion is avoided (`leftHeight == -1` and `rightHeight == -1` checks), effectively ""short-circuiting"" the unnecessary computation.
- The outer function `isBalanced` simply starts the recursive check at the root and returns `True` if the result is not `-1`.

### Elaborate Examples:
Consider the following binary tree:

```
      1
     / \
    2   2
   / \   
  3   3  
 /

The subtree rooted at the node with value `3` on the left-hand side has a height of 2, while the subtree rooted at the node with value `3` on the right-hand side has a height of 0. This difference is greater than 1, so the tree is not balanced and the function would return `False`.

### Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: \( O(N) \), where \( N \) is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited once.
- Space Complexity: \( O(H) \), where \( H \) is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (a completely unbalanced tree), \( H = N \), which would also make the space complexity \( O(N) \).

### Real-World Applications:
Balanced binary trees are crucial in many real-world scenarios where data needs to be fetched rapidly, like in databases and file systems. Knowing whether a tree is balanced can influence algorithm decisions to maintain optimal search, insert, and delete operations.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
One common mistake is to recompute heights repeatedly for the same nodes during the recursion. Another is not implementing a method for early termination when an imbalance is detected, resulting in unnecessary computation.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem fits into the ""Tree Traversal"" and ""Divide and Conquer"" patterns. Recognizing that you need to compare the height of subtrees and that you can solve the problem recursively from the bottom up is key to solving similar problems.

- LeetCode Problem 104 - Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
- LeetCode Problem 543 - Diameter of Binary Tree
- LeetCode Problem 124 - Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

Each of these problems also requires understanding the properties of a binary tree and using depth-first traversal to calculate some property of paths or nodes within the tree, similar to the balanced tree property."
111,"LeetCode Problem #111 is titled ""Minimum Depth of Binary Tree"". The problem falls under the category of Tree and Depth-first Search (DFS) or Breadth-first Search (BFS). Let's go through the various aspects of this problem.

### Problem Statement

The problem asks for the minimum depth of a binary tree, which is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node. A leaf is a node with no children.

Here's the formal definition given on LeetCode:

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

### Function Signature

The function signature provided in the problem is:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
```

### Inputs and Outputs

The input to the function is the root of a binary tree, and the output is an integer representing the minimum depth of the tree.

### Examples

Example 1:
- Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
- Output: 2
- Explanation: The shortest path to a leaf node is from the root (3) to one of its leaves (9), with only 2 nodes along the path. Hence, the minimum depth is 2.

Example 2:
- Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
- Output: 5
- Explanation: The tree is skewed to the right, and the shortest path is from the root down to the only leaf, with 5 nodes along the path.

### Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, there are generally two approaches:

#### DFS Approach

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a tree traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking. To find the minimum depth using DFS, you would recursively calculate the depth of both the left and right subtrees, and return the smaller one, plus one for the current node. One nuance to keep in mind is that in a situation where one of the subtrees of the current node is empty, you must return the depth of the other subtree plus one.

#### BFS Approach

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is another tree traversal algorithm that uses a queue to traverse the tree level by level, starting from the root. To find the minimum depth using BFS, you would traverse the tree level by level, and the depth of the first leaf node you encounter would be the minimum depth of the tree.

The BFS approach is often more efficient for this problem because it can stop as soon as it finds the first leaf node, while DFS always explores the entire tree.

### Python Code Explanation

We can take the BFS approach using a queue to implement the level order traversal:

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        
        queue = deque([(root, 1)])  # (node, depth)
        
        while queue:
            node, depth = queue.popleft()
            # Check if it's a leaf node
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                return depth
            if node.left:
                queue.append((node.left, depth + 1))
            if node.right:
                queue.append((node.right, depth + 1))
```

In this code, we start by checking if the root is None, in which case we return 0 as the depth of an empty tree. We then initialize a queue with a tuple containing the root and its depth (1). Inside the while loop, we pop the leftmost element of the queue, check if the current node is a leaf, and if so, return its depth. If it has children, we add them to the queue with the incremented depth. This process continues until we find a leaf node.

### Complexity Analysis

For both DFS and BFS approaches, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited once.

The space complexity for the DFS approach is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. However, the worst case (highly imbalanced tree) can degenerate to O(n).

For the BFS approach, the space complexity is O(w), where w is the maximum width of the tree (maximum number of nodes on a level). This is because we store only one level of the tree in the queue at a time.

### Real-World Applications

Finding the minimum depth of a binary tree might be a smaller part of a larger problem, such as optimizing search queries in hierarchical structures, networking algorithms to determine the minimum number of hops in a network, or decision tree analysis in machine learning models.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Edge case: An empty tree should return a depth of 0.
- When calculating depth for a node with a single child, remember to consider only the child that exists.
- To optimize the BFS approach, return immediately when the first leaf node is found.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem is a classic tree traversal problem that tests the understanding of DFS and BFS algorithms. Recognizing which traversal technique is better suited based on the problem can aid in solving similar tree-related problems.

112,"LeetCode problem number 112 is titled ""Path Sum"". This problem falls under the Tree category, and it is considered an easy problem in terms of difficulty. Here is a detailed breakdown of the problem, including its statement, solution rationale, code explanation, examples, complexity analysis, real-world applications, common pitfalls, related problems, and problem-solving patterns.

### Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the target sum.

A *leaf* is a node with no children.

Here's the struct definition of a binary tree node provided in the problem:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

### Input and Output Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
Output: true
```
Explanation: The path with the sequence [5,4,11,2] sums up to 22.

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
Output: false
```
Explanation: There are two root-to-leaf paths: [1,2] and [1,3]. Neither of them add up to 5.

**Example 3:**
```
Input: root = [], targetSum = 0
Output: false
```
Explanation: Since the tree is empty, there's no path, so the answer is false.

### Solution Rationale

The problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) traversal. Starting from the root of the binary tree, you can recursively check each path, subtracting the current node's value from the target sum until you reach a leaf node. When a leaf node is encountered, check if the remaining target sum equals the leaf node's value. If it does, that means a path sum equal to the target exists.

There are two recursive cases in this traversal:
1. If the current node is not a leaf, recursively visit its non-null children with an updated target sum.
2. If the current node is a leaf, check if the target sum is equal to the value of the current node.

The base case for the recursion is when you reach a null node (essentially falling off the tree), in which case, there is no path, so you return false.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

```python
def hasPathSum(root, targetSum):
    # Base case: if the root is None, no path exists
    if not root:
        return False
        
    # If we reach a leaf node, check if the remaining targetSum equals the node's value
    if not root.left and not root.right:
        return root.val == targetSum
        
    # Recursively call on the left and right subtree with updated targetSum
    left = hasPathSum(root.left, targetSum - root.val)
    right = hasPathSum(root.right, targetSum - root.val)
    
    # Return true if either the left or right subtree has a path sum that equals targetSum
    return left or right
```

#### Line-by-Line Explanation:

- `def hasPathSum(root, targetSum):` defines the function with a tree node `root` and an integer `targetSum`.
  
- `if not root: return False` is the base case checking for an empty tree (null node), in which case it returns False since there's no path.

- `if not root.left and not root.right: return root.val == targetSum` checks if the current node is a leaf (no left or right child) and returns True if the value of the node equals the remaining target sum, indicating a valid path has been found.

- `left = hasPathSum(root.left, targetSum - root.val)` recursively calls the same function for the left subtree while subtracting the current node's value from `targetSum`.

- `right = hasPathSum(root.right, targetSum - root.val)` does the same for the right subtree.

- `return left or right` will return True if either the left or right recursive call found a valid path sum. If neither subtree has a path sum that equals `targetSum`, the function will ultimately return False.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's consider a binary tree `[1, 2]` with `targetSum = 3`. The function `hasPathSum` is called with the root node (val=1).

Here are the steps of execution:

1. The current node 1 is not null, and it's not a leaf, so we continue.
2. We recursively call `hasPathSum` on node 2 with `targetSum` updated to 2 (3 - 1).
3. The node 2 is a leaf. We check if its value equals the updated `targetSum` (which it does), and return True.
4. Since the left subtree returned True, the initial call also returns True.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we potentially have to visit every node once to check all paths.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This stems from the maximum depth of the recursive call stack. For a balanced tree, this would be O(log n), but in the worst case (a skewed tree), it could be O(n).

### Real-World Applications

The ""Path Sum"" problem can be related to various real-world scenarios involving hierarchical structures where we want to determine if a cumulative sum along a certain path reaches a specific value. Examples include:
- Evaluating budget allocations in organizational structures.
- Summing up costs in a product component tree where each node represents a part contributing to the total cost.
- Analyzing energy consumption in a network of connected systems.

### Common Pitfalls

- Neglecting to handle edge cases, such as an empty tree or trees with only one node.
- Not properly identifying a leaf node (a common mistake is to check only one child instead of both).
- Not correctly updating the `targetSum` during the recursive calls.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem is an example of the Depth-First Search (DFS) approach for tree traversal. Recognizing that we can use a recursive algorithm to explore each root-to-leaf path is key in solving this and similar problems.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems

Other problems that involve similar traversal and path-sum concepts include:
- LeetCode #113 (Path Sum II) — find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.
- LeetCode #129 (Sum Root to Leaf Numbers) — compute the sum of all numbers formed by root-to-leaf paths.
- LeetCode #437 (Path Sum III) — find the number of paths that sum to a given value (the paths do not need to start at the root and end at a leaf).

Each of these problems can build upon the skills learned in solving the ""Path Sum"" problem, expanding the understanding of tree traversal and recursive algorithms in various scenarios."
113,"LeetCode Problem #113 is titled ""Path Sum II"". This problem focuses on finding all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree where each path's sum equals a given target sum.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

Here is a deeper analysis of the problem statement:
- You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.
- A path in a tree is a sequence of nodes where there is a connection between any two adjacent nodes in the sequence.
- A root-to-leaf path is a path starting at the root of the tree and ending at a leaf node (a node that has no children).
- Your objective is to find all such paths where the sum of the values along the path equals a given integer target sum.
- The solution should return these paths as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a valid path, and the values are in the order they are encountered on the path from root to leaf.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, we can use a recursive depth-first search (DFS) strategy. This involves traversing the tree by going as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking. DFS is particularly suitable for this problem because it naturally follows a path from the root to a leaf. Here's a general outline of the steps you would take:

1. Perform a DFS starting from the root node, keeping track of the current path you're on and the sum of the values in that path.
2. As you traverse the tree, for each node, add its value to the current path sum.
3. If a leaf node is encountered (no children), check if the current path sum equals the target sum. If it does, save the current path as a valid answer.
4. If a leaf node is not encountered or the sum does not match, backtrack and try other paths.
5. Do this recursively until all paths are checked.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

I will now write the corresponding Python code to solve the problem and then break it down line by line.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def pathSum(self, root: TreeNode, targetSum: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        def dfs(node, curr_sum, path):
            if not node:
                return
            
            # Include current node's value in the path and update the sum
            curr_sum += node.val
            path.append(node.val)
            
            # Check if the current node is a leaf and sum equals target sum
            if not node.left and not node.right and curr_sum == targetSum:
                paths.append(list(path))
            else:
                # If not leaf, continue DFS on child nodes
                dfs(node.left, curr_sum, path)
                dfs(node.right, curr_sum, path)
            
            # Backtrack to explore other paths
            path.pop()
        
        paths = []
        dfs(root, 0, [])
        return paths
```

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

- `TreeNode` class definition: A standard definition for a binary tree node object with `val`, `left`, and `right` attributes.
- `Solution` class with `pathSum` method: Takes a `TreeNode` representing the root of the binary tree and an integer `targetSum`.
- Inside `pathSum`, we define a nested `dfs` helper function for depth-first search. This method takes three parameters: `node` (current node), `curr_sum` (sum of values in the current path), and `path` (list of values from root to the current node).
- If the `node` is `None`, it means we have hit a dead end, so we return without doing anything.
- We add the `node`'s value to both `curr_sum` and `path`.
- If the `node` is a leaf (`not node.left and not node.right`) and `curr_sum` equals `targetSum`, we append a copy of `path` to the `paths` list as a valid solution.
- If the `node` is not a leaf, we recursively call `dfs` on both the left and right children of `node`, passing the current state of `curr_sum` and the `path`.
- We perform a `path.pop()` to backtrack and remove the last inserted node value, allowing us to try alternate paths after returning from the recursive call.
- `paths` is defined as a list that will store the found paths and initialized before starting the DFS.
- We start the DFS with a call to `dfs(root, 0, [])`, passing in the root node, a sum of `0` since we are at the start of a path, and an empty list for `path`.
- The `pathSum` function then returns the `paths` list as the result.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's consider the following binary tree and assume the target sum is 22:

```
    5
   / \
  4   8
 /   / \
11  13  4
/ \     / \
7  2   5   1
```

The recursion will explore paths `[5, 4, 11, 7]`, `[5, 4, 11, 2]`, `[5, 8, 13]`, and `[5, 8, 4, 5]`, `[5, 8, 4, 1]`. Among these, the paths that sum to 22 are `[5, 4, 11, 2]` and `[5, 8, 4, 5]`. These would be the correct output.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: Each node in the tree is visited once, which gives us O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity depends on the height of the tree due to the call stack during recursion and can be O(log N) in the best case (balanced tree) and O(N) in the worst case (completely unbalanced tree). Additionally, space is needed to store the valid paths, which can potentially be O(NlogN) if every path is equal to the target sum (every leaf node results in a path that needs to be recorded).

### Real-World Applications:

This algorithm could be used in computing where you may have a hierarchical structure representing decisions with associated costs, and you would like to find all sequences of decisions that lead to a particular budget.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- **Backtracking**: It is essential to remember to ""undo"" the last step when recursion returns. This is what `path.pop()` does in the code.
- **List Copying**: When you find a valid path, you need to append a copy of it to the list of paths (`paths.append(list(path))`), or else subsequent modifications to the path will affect the stored paths.
- **Edge Cases**: Including checks for None nodes and confirming that a node is a leaf are crucial to prevent invalid paths or crashes due to null references.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem is a typical example of a tree-based DFS with backtracking. Recognizing DFS patterns is useful in a wide range of problems that involve exploring all possibilities or searching for particular configurations in a state space, like combinatorial problems, puzzles, and game playing algorithms.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:

Related problems that involve tree traversal or a similar DFS-based approach include:
- LeetCode #112: ""Path Sum"" (simpler variant of this problem, where you just need to find if there exists at least one such path)
- LeetCode #437: ""Path Sum III"" (finds the number of paths that sum to a given value)
- LeetCode #129: ""Sum Root to Leaf Numbers"" (sums the numbers represented by the root-to-leaf paths)
- LeetCode #98: ""Validate Binary Search Tree"" (a different tree traversal problem where you're checking a property of the tree rather than finding paths)

Each of these problems reinforces the understanding of DFS traversal in trees and the subtle variations in using additional data structures or modifying the traversal logic based on the specific requirements."
114,"LeetCode problem number 114 is titled ""Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List"". This problem requires you to flatten a binary tree into a linked list in-place. The linked list should use the right child pointers and the left child pointers should all be null. The ordering should be the same as the pre-order traversal of the binary tree.

Let's break this problem down in detail before presenting a solution strategy.

### Problem Statement:
Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a ""linked list"":
- The ""linked list"" should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.
- The linked list should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.
  
Here's an example of the problem statement:

Given binary tree:
```plaintext
    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6
```

The flattened tree should look like:
```plaintext
1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6
```

### Solution Rationale:
To flatten the tree, there are several methods you might consider:

1. Recursion (DFS):
   - Traverse the tree using depth-first search (DFS), specifically in a pre-order fashion (node → left → right).
   - While traversing, we reconstruct the tree by:
     - Flattening the left subtree and the right subtree.
     - Setting the current node's right child to the flattened left subtree.
     - Appending the flattened right subtree to the end of the flattened left subtree.
     - Setting the left child to `null`.
     
2. Iterative Approach:
   - Start from the root and process nodes iteratively.
   - You can perform a modified pre-order traversal that flattens the tree as you go.

3. Morris Traversal (Threaded Binary Tree):
   - This is an in-place tree traversal algorithm that does not require recursion or a stack.
   - The idea is to create a temporary link called a ""thread"" from the rightmost node back to the current node.

4. Stack-based DFS:
   - Utilize a stack to simulate the recursive DFS behavior.
   - This method also involves a pre-order style traversal, flattening the tree iteratively.

### Python Code Explanation:
In this example, I'll provide a recursive DFS solution in Python due to its simplicity and intuitive alignment with the problem's requirements. Here's a step-by-step code walkthrough:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def flatten(self, root: TreeNode) -> None:
        if not root:
            return None
        
        # Flatten the left and right subtrees
        self.flatten(root.left)
        self.flatten(root.right)
        
        # Store the flattened right subtree to reconnect it later
        temp_right = root.right
        # Reconnect the flattened left subtree to the right
        root.right = root.left
        root.left = None  # Set the left child to None
        
        # Find the end of the new right subtree and reconnect the original right subtree
        while root.right:
            root = root.right
        root.right = temp_right
```

### Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(N), as we visit each node exactly once, where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
- Space Complexity: O(H), where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case of a skewed tree, the space complexity would be O(N).

### Real-World Applications:
This problem can be related to the in-memory representation of hierarchical data structures, which might need to be flattened for serialization, database storage, or network transmission.

### Potential Pitfalls and Tips:
- Do not create new nodes; the problem requires you to use the existing nodes and simply rearrange the pointers.
- Make sure to handle the left subtree before the right subtree because we need to place the flattened left subtree before the right one.
- Remember to set the left pointers of all nodes to `null`.

115,"LeetCode Problem 115 is titled ""Distinct Subsequences,"" which is a problem in the domain of dynamic programming. Here is a detailed breakdown of the problem, which will be followed by in-depth explanations of potential solutions and their complexities.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The problem statement is as follows:

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the number of distinct subsequences of `s` that equal `t`. A string's subsequence is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., ""ACE"" is a subsequence of ""ABCDE"" while ""AEC"" is not).

For example:

- If `s = ""rabbbit""` and `t = ""rabbit""`, the answer is `3`.
- If `s = ""babgbag""` and `t = ""bag""`, the answer is `5`.

The main challenges in this problem are:

1. Understanding what a subsequence is and the ways in which it can be formed.
2. Determining possible methods to count distinct subsequences without actually generating them.
3. Implementing an efficient algorithm that does not result in a time-out due to the potentially large input size.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, we must employ dynamic programming, which is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. The intuition behind the solution comes from noticing that the number of distinct subsequences in a string `s` up to index `i` that matches string `t` up to index `j` can be derived from:

1. The number of distinct subsequences in `s` up to `i-1` that match `t` up to `j` if `s[i]` does not equal `t[j]`.
2. The sum of the above value and the number of distinct subsequences in `s` up to `i-1` that match `t` up to `j-1` if `s[i]` equals `t[j]`.

This leads to the construction of a two-dimensional dynamic programming table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of distinct subsequences of `s[:i]` that equal `t[:j]`. Note that `s[:i]` implies substring of `s` from the beginning up to but not including index `i`.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

We will construct a dynamic programming table and iterate through both strings, updating the table according to the rules described.

```python
def numDistinct(s, t):
    m, n = len(s), len(t)
    # Create a 2D DP table with an extra row and column for empty substring cases.
    dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]
    
    # Base case initialization: an empty string t """" is a subsequence of any prefix of s.
    for i in range(m+1):
        dp[i][0] = 1
    
    # Fill in the DP table
    for i in range(1, m+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            # Copy the value from the top cell if characters don't match.
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
            # If characters match, add the value from the diagonal cell as well.
            if s[i-1] == t[j-1]:
                dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-1]
    
    # The bottom-right cell contains the number of distinct subsequences.
    return dp[-1][-1]
```

### Elaborate Examples

Let's take `s = ""babgbag""` and `t = ""bag""` as an example and fill the DP table:

```
   """" b a g
"""" 1  0 0 0
b  1  1 0 0
a  1  1 1 0
b  1  2 1 0
g  1  2 1 1
b  1  3 3 1
a  1  3 4 1
g  1  3 4 5
```

Each cell in the table accumulates the count of distinct subsequences matching so far.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the algorithm is `O(m*n)`, where `m` is the length of string `s` and `n` is the length of string `t`, since we need to iterate through each character of `s` for every character of `t` to fill the DP table.

The space complexity is also `O(m*n)` due to the DP table size. However, we can optimize the space to `O(n)` by using only one row at a time, since each row only depends on the previous row.

### Real-World Applications

The problem of finding distinct subsequences is related to many real-world scenarios in bioinformatics, text processing, and pattern recognition, where such algorithms are used to match patterns allowing for deletions.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Remembering to initialize the base case correctly for an empty `t`.
- Ensuring that the indices are properly handled, since the table has one extra row and column compared to strings `s` and `t` indexes.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem can be identified as a classical dynamic programming problem, specifically dealing with sequence alignment which is quite common in bioinformatics.

116,"The LeetCode problem with the number 116 is titled ""Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node"". Here is a detailed breakdown of the problem and how to approach a solution in Python.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

This problem is part of the tree data structure category and specifically deals with a perfect binary tree. A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.

The goal of the problem is to connect each node to its next right node at the same level. For the last node in each level, since there is no node to the right of it, its `next` pointer should be set to `nullptr` (or in Python, `None`). This should be done in a way that each node's next pointer is set to the right node on the same level of the binary tree.

A new data structure is defined for the tree node, which includes a next pointer along with the usual val, left, and right pointers:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.next = next
```

The binary tree is initially not connected, i.e., all `next` pointers are `None`.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, we can consider several approaches. However, one of the most intuitive methods is to perform a level-order traversal (also known as breadth-first search) since we need to connect nodes on the same level. During the level-order traversal, we can connect the next pointers of the nodes at the current level before moving on to the next level.

However, given the nature of the problem and the perfect binary tree condition, we can also devise a more space-efficient approach that utilizes the fact that we are dealing with a perfect binary tree, which would allow using the next pointers themselves for traversal instead of an auxiliary data structure like a queue.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Here is an example of an efficient solution that leverages the perfect binary tree structure:

```python
def connect(root):
    if not root:
        return None
    
    leftmost = root  # Start with the root node
    while leftmost.left:  # The loop runs until we reach the last level
        head = leftmost  # Head of the current level
        while head:  # Iterate over all nodes in the current level
            head.left.next = head.right  # Connect the left child to the right child
            
            # If there is a next right node, connect the right child to the left child
            # of the next node
            if head.next:
                head.right.next = head.next.left
            
            # Move to the next node on the current level
            head = head.next
        
        # Move to the next level
        leftmost = leftmost.left
    
    return root
```

Here's what each part of the code does:

- We start by checking if the root is `None`. If it is, there's nothing to connect, so we return `None`.

- We initialize a variable `leftmost` to keep track of the leftmost node at the current level. Initially, this is the root.

- The outer `while` loop runs as long as there are more levels to process, which is indicated by `leftmost.left`.

- Inside the loop, we use the `head` variable to traverse the current level. This variable starts at the leftmost node and moves rightward.

- For each node at the current level, we perform two connections:
    - We connect the `left` child to the `right` child of the current node (`head`).
    - If there is a next node (`head.next`), we connect the `right` child of the current node to the `left` child of the next node.

- After connecting the children of the current node, we move the `head` to the `next` node on the same level.

- When we've finished connecting all nodes at the current level, we move to the next level by setting `leftmost` to its left child.

- At the end of the process, we return the `root` of the tree. Now the `next` pointers are appropriately set.

### Elaborate Examples:

Imagine a perfect binary tree like this:

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \ / \
    4  5 6  7
```

After running the function `connect`, the tree should have the `next` pointers connected as follows (denoted by arrows):

```
        1 -> None
       / \
      2 -> 3 -> None
     / \ / \
    4->5->6->7 -> None
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: The time complexity for this algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once to set its `next` pointer.

- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) as we do not use any additional data structure for level traversal. Since we are leveraging the next pointers themselves to navigate through the levels, no extra space is required besides the input data structure. We are only using a fixed number of pointers to keep track of nodes at the current level.

### Real-World Applications:

This problem can be seen as an abstraction of tasks that involve linking similar entities that are on the same hierarchy or level. For example, in networking, arranging devices in a ring topology where each device is connected to its next device on the same network level, or in process scheduling, connecting processes at the same priority level for efficient scheduling.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

One common pitfall is neglecting the perfect binary tree condition of the problem. This assumption allows us to avoid using additional data structures and complete the problem with constant space complexity.

The main trick lies in utilizing the `next` pointers to traverse the tree level by level, which is a unique characteristic of the problem and not a common technique in tree traversal.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem can be identified as a tree traversal problem with an application of the level-order traversal pattern. Recognizing this pattern is essential because many other tree problems use similar traversal techniques.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:

Similar problems that involve manipulating tree structures or performing specific traversals on them include:

- LeetCode 117: ""Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II"" (a more general form of this problem without the perfect binary tree assumption).
- LeetCode 199: ""Binary Tree Right Side View"" (involves visualizing the tree from the right side).
- LeetCode 102: ""Binary Tree Level Order Traversal"" (typical level-order traversal).
- LeetCode 107: ""Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II"" (level-order traversal but traversing from the bottom up).
- LeetCode 429: ""N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal"" (a level-order traversal in a tree where nodes can have more than two children).

In each of these problems, the skills learned in the current problem can be applied, especially handling tree node connections and traversing the tree level by level."
117,"LeetCode Problem #117 is titled ""Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II"". This problem is an extension of the earlier problem ""Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node"" which is restricted to perfect binary trees. Problem #117 broadens the scope to any binary tree, which may not be perfect or complete.

### Problem Statement

Given a binary tree:

```
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

#### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the given tree is less than 6000.
- `-100 <= node.val <= 100`

### Examples

#### Example 1:

- **Input**: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
- **Output**: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#]

Explanation: Given the following binary tree,

```
     1 --> NULL
   /  \
  2 --> 3 --> NULL
 / \    \
4--> 5 --> 7 --> NULL
```

Your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in the output diagram above.

#### Example 2:

- **Input**: root = []
- **Output**: []

Explanation: Given an empty tree, the output is also an empty tree.

### Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, we need an approach that can work with potentially unbalanced trees. The main idea is to iteratively establish the `next` connections level by level, starting from the root. At each node, we first connect its children, and then we connect its next neighbor's children. An iterative level-order traversal can achieve this, but we will optimize it to use constant extra space.

#### Solution Steps:

1. We start from the root and establish a dummy head that will point to the first node of the next level.
2. We will maintain a current pointer for nodes on the current level and another one for the nodes on the next level.
3. For each node in the current level, we will:
   - Connect the next pointer of its left child to its right child if both exist.
   - Find the next available child in the next nodes.
   - Repeat this process until we finish the current level.
4. Move to the next level and repeat the same process until there are no more levels.

### Python Code

Let's write Python code to solve this problem:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.next = next

def connect(root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
    if not root:
        return None
    
    # Starting with the root level
    current_level_head = root
    
    # Iterate over each level
    while current_level_head:
        dummy = Node(0)  # To keep track of the start of the next level
        tail = dummy  # To attach nodes to the next level
        
        # Iterate over nodes in the current level
        current = current_level_head
        while current:
            if current.left:
                tail.next = current.left
                tail = tail.next
            if current.right:
                tail.next = current.right
                tail = tail.next
            # Move to next node in the current level
            current = current.next
        
        # Move to the next level
        current_level_head = dummy.next
    
    return root
```

### Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is processed exactly once.

Space Complexity: O(1), since we're not using any additional data structure for intermediate computations, except for a few variables to keep track of nodes.

### Real-World Applications

This problem's real-world application could be in UI development or gaming, where there's a hierarchical structure, and we need to traverse or update the structure efficiently. Another example might be in real-time systems, where trees represent tasks, and the 'next' pointers can be used to implement a scheduler with quick access to the next task.

### Common Pitfalls

One common pitfall is to assume the tree is perfect or complete while it is not. Always keep in mind that this variant of the problem works with any binary tree.

Another pitfall may be trying to use extra space for queue data structure to perform level order traversal. This will not meet the space complexity requirement of the problem.

118,"LeetCode problem number 118 is titled ""Pascal's Triangle"" and it is in the category of array problems. The goal of this problem is to generate Pascal's Triangle up to a certain number of rows. Here's an extensive breakdown of the problem, solution strategies (including Python-specific features), examples, complexity analysis, real-world applications, common pitfalls, tricks, problem pattern identification, and links to similar problems.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. It is constructed by starting with a single 1 at the top, followed by each row below containing one more entry than the previous one. Each number in the interior of the triangle, not on the edges which are all 1's, is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

The challenge presents the problem as follows:
- Given a non-negative integer numRows, generate the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.
- In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:

```
   1
  1 1
 1 2 1
1 3 3 1
```

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
To solve this problem, we can make use of a list to maintain the state of the current row in the triangle while constructing the next row. Given that a new row in Pascal's triangle is generated based on the previous row, we can iterate from the first row to the numRows-th row, computing the new rows iteratively.

A common approach goes as follows:
- Initialize a list `triangle` that will hold each row as a sublist.
- For each row from 0 to numRows:
  - Initialize the current row with 1 (because the first element is always 1).
  - For each element in the row, starting at the second position and ending one element before the last, set it to the sum of the elements from the previous row that are directly above it (i.e., `prev_row[j-1] + prev_row[j]`).
  - Append 1 to the current row (because the last element is always 1).
  - Add the current row to the `triangle` list.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
Let's write this algorithm in Python and explain each part:

```python
def generate(numRows):
    triangle = []  # This will hold the rows of Pascal's triangle.

    for row_number in range(numRows):
        # Initialize the row with 1 because the first element is always 1.
        row = [1] * (row_number + 1)

        # Now we iterate over the elements from the second position to the
        # second-to-last, updating the value based on the previous row.
        for j in range(1, row_number):
            row[j] = triangle[row_number - 1][j - 1] + triangle[row_number - 1][j]

        # The last element is already 1, so now row is complete and we can add it to triangle.
        triangle.append(row)

    return triangle
```

- `triangle` is our main list that gets returned at the end of the function.
- We use a for loop to generate rows of the triangle, with `row_number` being our incrementing variable.
- Inside the loop, we start with creating a row initialized with `1`s using list multiplication `[1] * (row_number + 1)`.
- We then update the inner elements of the row using a nested for loop. Note that we start from 1 and go to `row_number` to avoid updating the first and last elements which are always `1`.
- Within the nested loop, we reference the previous row using `triangle[row_number - 1]` and sum the corresponding elements.
- Finally, we append `row` to `triangle`.

### Elaborate Examples:
Let's demonstrate the solution with `numRows = 5`:

```python
result = generate(5)
print(result)
```

This should output the following triangle:

```
[
     [1],
    [1, 1],
   [1, 2, 1],
  [1, 3, 3, 1],
 [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
]
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(numRows^2) since we must iterate through each element in each row to construct the triangle and each subsequent row grows by one element.
Space Complexity: O(numRows^2) for the storage of the triangle itself. There are no additional data structures that grow with `numRows` beyond the output list.

### Real-World Applications:
Pascal's Triangle has applications in combinatorics, binomial expansions, and probability theory. Understanding how to generate and manipulate the triangle can be useful in solving problems related to these domains or any application involving binomial coefficients.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- Remember the edges are always `1`, so start the iteration from the second element and stop before the last element in a row.
- Be careful with the indices; off-by-one errors are common. For example, the `j` in the loop should start at `1` and not `0`.
- Python's ability to multiply lists (e.g., `[1] * (row_number + 1)`) is a handy trick to initialize lists with repeated values.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem uses a dynamic programming pattern. Similar to many dynamic programming problems, we're building up a solution by starting from a base case and then adding on top of previously computed values.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:
Similar problems related to dynamic programming or specific properties of Pascal's Triangle include:
- LeetCode 119 (Pascal's Triangle II): This problem involves finding a specific row in Pascal's Triangle without having to generate the triangle up to that row.
- LeetCode 53 (Maximum Subarray): Although not directly related to Pascal's Triangle, it is also a dynamic programming problem where you build up a solution using previously computed values.
- LeetCode 70 (Climbing Stairs): This problem, while distinct in context, shares the principle of building upon previously computed steps, showcasing the same underlying dynamic programming pattern.

Through mastering the Pascal's Triangle problem, not only do we become familiar with the structure and properties of the triangle itself, but we also learn a foundational pattern of dynamic programming that's widely applicable in algorithm design."
119,"LeetCode problem number 119 is titled ""Pascal's Triangle II."" The problem falls under the category of array and is generally considered to be an easy-level problem. However, understanding the nuances is crucial for an optimal solution.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The problem statement asks you to return the kth (0-indexed) row of Pascal's Triangle. Pascal’s Triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

Unlike the previous problem, where you were asked to generate the entire Pascal's triangle up to a certain number of rows, in this problem, you are only required to return the row corresponding to the provided index `k`. This constraint allows for more targeted, efficient solutions that use less memory since you only need to keep track of one row at a time.

Pascal's Triangle follows a simple rule: each element (except for the edges that are always 1) is obtained by adding the number above and to the left with the number above and to the right. For example, the first few rows of Pascal's Triangle are:

```
     1
    1 1
   1 2 1
  1 3 3 1
 1 4 6 4 1
```

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

There are multiple ways to approach this problem. A naïve approach would be to simply build Pascal's Triangle row by row until you reach the kth row. This is not the most optimal solution because you would be generating rows that you do not need.

A more efficient approach is to recognize that the kth row of Pascal's Triangle corresponds to the coefficients of the binomial expansion (a + b)^k. However, calculating the binomial coefficients can be computationally expensive, especially for larger values of k, so there are more optimized methods to generate the kth row directly.

An optimal solution uses the fact that each element can be generated using the previous element in the kth row:

```plaintext
row[i] = row[i-1] * (k - i + 1) / i
```

This equation comes from the properties of the binomial coefficients, where each term of a Pascal's Triangle row is equivalent to ""k choose i"".

#### Python Code Walkthrough

With the aforementioned insights, you can write a Python function that iteratively builds the kth row of Pascal's Triangle:

```python
def getRow(rowIndex):
    row = [1]
    for i in range(1, rowIndex + 1):
        row.append(row[i - 1] * (rowIndex - i + 1) // i)
    return row
```

Let's break down the code:
- `row` is initialized as `[1]`, the base case for the first row of Pascal's Triangle.
- The `for` loop goes from `1` to the `rowIndex` (inclusive) to build up the elements of the target row.
- Inside the loop, a new element is appended to `row`. This element is calculated from the previous element (`row[i - 1]`), multiplied by `(rowIndex - i + 1)` to get the upper part of the binomial coefficient, and divided by `i` (integer division `//`) to get the correct binomial coefficient without the need for factorial calculations.
- Finally, the function returns the complete `row`.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's consider an example by running the function with the input `3`, which should give us the third row of Pascal's Triangle (0-indexed).

```python
rowIndex = 3
print(getRow(rowIndex))
# Output should be [1, 3, 3, 1]
```

For `rowIndex = 3`, the function would perform the following steps:
1. Initialize `row` as `[1]`.
2. First loop iteration: `row.append(1 * (3 - 1 + 1) // 1)` which is `row.append(3)`; now `row` is `[1, 3]`.
3. Second loop iteration: `row.append(3 * (3 - 2 + 1) // 2)` which is `row.append(3)`; now `row` is `[1, 3, 3]`.
4. Third loop iteration: `row.append(3 * (3 - 3 + 1) // 3)` which is `row.append(1)`; now `row` is `[1, 3, 3, 1]`.
5. Return `[1, 3, 3, 1]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the given `rowIndex`. This is because the function calculates each element of the row in constant time and iterates once through the row length, which is the same as the rowIndex.

The space complexity is also O(n), as we need space to store the output row, with n being the rowIndex. No extra space is needed other than what's used to output the result, which makes this an in-place operation.

### Real-World Applications

Pascal's Triangle has various applications in mathematics, computer science, and other fields. For example:

- Combinatorics: The triangle is a representation of the binomial coefficients, which are useful in combinatorial mathematics for calculating combinations.
- Probability: In probability theory, binomial coefficients are used to determine the probabilities of certain outcomes, such as flipping coins or drawing cards.
- Algebra: The coefficients are applied in the expansion of binomial expressions.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

When implementing algorithms like this, there are a few things to watch out for:

1. Integer Overflow: While Python handles large integers well, in other languages or systems, calculating large binomial coefficients can lead to integer overflow. It's important to use appropriate data types or work with modulo arithmetic when needed.
2. Floating-Point Precision: Avoid using floating-point arithmetic to calculate the coefficients, as it can introduce rounding errors. Always use integer division when possible.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem exemplifies a computational pattern where recognizing mathematical properties can optimize the solution. Instead of brute-force computation, using a smart mathematical observation reduces both time and space complexity.

Would you like to see the solution executed with an example, or do you require further clarification on any of the points?"
120,"The LeetCode problem with the number 120 is the ""Triangle"" problem. Here's a comprehensive analysis of the problem:

### Problem Statement:

Given a `triangle` array, we need to find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step, we may move to the adjacent numbers on the row below. The triangle array is a list of lists of integers where `triangle[i]` contains `i+1` elements.

The problem can be visualized as an actual triangle, where each level corresponds to an element of the triangle array, and the values are the actual numbers in the triangle.

```
For example, a triangle array might look like this:

   [2],
  [3,4],
 [6,5,7],
[4,1,8,3]

Which represents the triangle:

     2
    3 4
   6 5 7
  4 1 8 3
```

The goal is to start from the top and reach the bottom with the smallest possible sum of numbers, where each step is either directly down or diagonally to the right.

### Solution Strategy:

There are several approaches one could take to solve this problem:

1. Recursive Solution (Top-Down Approach): We can recursively calculate the minimum path sum starting from the top element of the triangle, going down to each of the two adjacent numbers, and keeping track of the minimum at each step. However, this approach has exponential time complexity due to a large number of redundant calculations.

2. Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up Approach): A more efficient way is to use dynamic programming to build up the solution from the bottom of the triangle. We can iterate from the second-last row to the top row and calculate the minimum path sum by adding the current element with the minimum of its two adjacent elements on the row below. This approach is both time and space-efficient.

3. In-Place Dynamic Programming: This is a variation of the Bottom-Up approach. Instead of using an auxiliary space to keep track of intermediate results, we can modify the given triangle array in place, which saves space.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's focus on the in-place dynamic programming approach, which is usually preferred due to its efficiency:

```python
def minimumTotal(triangle):
    # Start from the second last row and move upward
    for row in range(len(triangle) - 2, -1, -1):
        # For each cell in the current row
        for col in range(len(triangle[row])):
            # Update the current cell with the sum of its value and 
            # the minimum of the two adjacent cells in the row below
            triangle[row][col] += min(triangle[row + 1][col], triangle[row + 1][col + 1])
    
    # The result is now at the top of the triangle
    return triangle[0][0]
```

In this code:
- We start looping from the second-last row to the top (`for row in range(len(triangle) - 2, -1, -1)`).
- We access each element of the current row (`for col in range(len(triangle[row]))`).
- We update each element by adding itself to the minimum of its two adjacent numbers from the row below (`triangle[row][col] += min(...)`).
- Once the loop is finished, the top element of the triangle (`triangle[0][0]`) contains the minimum path sum.

### Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: Since every element of the triangle is looked at exactly once, the time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the number of rows in the triangle.
- Space Complexity: We do not use any extra space except for a few variables for iteration. Thus, the space complexity is O(1) since it updates the original triangle in place.

### Practical Applications:

This kind of problem is abstract but could be likened to decision-making pathways where the goal is to reach a decision or endpoint with the lowest cost associated, potentially applicable to optimizations in routing, resource allocation, etc.

### Common Pitfalls and Tips:

- The main pitfall is to attempt a recursive solution without memoization, which would lead to a much higher runtime due to redundant calculations.
- Ensure to understand the difference between the bottom-up and top-down approaches. Bottom-up typically leads to simpler and more efficient algorithms in dynamic programming scenarios.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem is an example of dynamic programming, a common pattern where optimal solutions to subproblems are reused to build up solutions to larger problems.

121,"LeetCode Problem 121 is titled ""Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock."" Here is a detailed analysis of the problem:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

This problem involves an algorithmic challenge that requires you to maximize profit by choosing the best day to buy and sell a stock. The problem provides you with an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`-th day.

The goal is to find the maximum profit that can be achieved. You can complete at most one transaction, which means you can buy one and sell one share of the stock. You cannot sell a stock before you buy one, and you are looking to maximize the difference (sell price - buy price).

#### Restrictions and Nuances:

1. If no profit can be made, the function should return 0.
2. The input list represents the stock price over a series of days, and you want to find the best single buy-sell pair.
3. You must buy before you sell.
4. The input will have at least 1 price and at most 10^5 prices, with each individual price being a non-negative integer.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The problem can be approached in several ways:

#### 1. Brute Force

The brute force method would be to try every pair of buy-sell days to find the maximum profit. This would mean nested loops where you compare all possible buy-sell combinations. However, the time complexity of this approach is O(n^2), where n is the number of prices, making it inefficient for large inputs.

#### 2. One Pass

The idea here is to iterate through the price list once and keep track of the minimum price witnessed so far and the maximum profit that can be achieved. We continuously update the minimum price when a lower price is found, and at each step, we also calculate the profit that could be made if we sold the stock at the current price, updating the maximum profit when a higher profit is calculated.

This method has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it efficient for this problem.

#### Detailed Python Code Explanation

The optimal solution in Python using the One Pass method could look like this:

```python
def maxProfit(prices):
    min_price = float('inf')  # Initialize min_price to infinity
    max_profit = 0  # Initialize max_profit to 0
    
    for price in prices:
        # Update min_price if the current price is lower than the known minimum
        min_price = min(min_price, price)
        
        # Calculate the profit of selling at the current price given the min_price
        profit = price - min_price
        
        # Update max_profit if the current profit is greater than the known maximum
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        
    return max_profit
```

Each operation inside the loop serves a specific purpose:

- The `min()` function updates the `min_price` if a lower price is found.
- We calculate the potential `profit` by subtracting the `min_price` from the current price.
- The `max()` function updates the `max_profit` if the potential profit is greater.

#### Elaborate Examples

Consider the following scenarios:

- `prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]`. The optimal purchase would be at price `1` and sale at price `6`, leading to the maximum profit of `5`.
- `prices = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]`. It is never optimal to buy since the price only decreases, so the maximum profit is `0`.

#### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the one-pass solution is O(n) because it iterates over the list of prices once. The space complexity is O(1) because only two variables are maintained regardless of the size of the input.

### Real-World Applications

This problem metaphorically models any scenario where you're looking to maximize profit from a singular investment based on fluctuating values. This includes stock market investments, currency exchange, or commodity trading. The algorithm could be applied to historical data to determine the best time for a transaction within a given period.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- One common mistake is not accounting for the possibility of no profitable transactions. Your algorithm must handle cases where it is best not to engage in any transaction.
- Another pitfall is overcomplicating the problem by trying to use fancy algorithms or data structures when a simple linear scan suffices.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem follows the pattern of array manipulation and dynamic programming to a certain extent. Recognizing that you only need to track the minimum value and the maximum profit at each step is crucial and can be applied to similar problems involving profit maximization or min/max tracking during iteration.

All these problems expand on the core idea of finding optimal buy and sell points but introduce new constraints or modify the problem in a way that requires tweaking the original approach."
122,"LeetCode Problem 122 is titled ""Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II"". This is a classical problem in algorithmic trading and dynamic programming. Let's start with an extensive problem breakdown.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The problem statement gives you an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`th day. The goal is to determine the maximum profit you can achieve by making as many transactions as you want, with the only constraint being that you must sell the stock before you buy again.

Here are some key points from the problem statement:

1. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
2. You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
3. No transaction fees or taxes are considered in the problem.
4. The prices array is guaranteed to have at least one day of stock prices.

With these considerations, we need to create an algorithm that can maximize profit from the stock prices given. One might initially think about the greedy approach to solve this problem. That is, every time we see a price that is higher than the previous one, we can consider it as a profit opportunity.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

A naive approach to this problem might involve complex analyses of price trends to determine the best days to buy and sell. However, a key insight simplifies the problem greatly: if we buy on one day and sell on the next day whenever there is a profit to be made, we will achieve the maximum possible profit.

This is because stock prices can be thought of as a graph, and the optimal profit can be obtained by summing up all the ""ascending"" parts of the graph. Why does this work? Because the sum of all individual profits of each ascending segment is equal to the profit we would make if we were to buy at the beginning of the first ascending segment and sell at the end of the last one.

#### Example:
```
For price array [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4], buying at 1 and selling at 5, buying at 3, and selling at 6 will give the same profit as buying at 1 and selling at 6.
```

Thus, the algorithm is pretty straightforward:
- Iterate through the `prices` array.
- At each step, if the current price is greater than the previous day's price, we take the difference as profit.
- Accumulate all such profits.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_profit = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prices[i - 1]:
                max_profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1]
        return max_profit
```

In this Python code, the `maxProfit` function:
- Initializes `max_profit` to `0` to keep track of the accumulated profit.
- Iterates through the list of prices starting from the second price (`i` starting from `1`).
- On each day (`i`), it checks if the current price is greater than the previous day's price.
    - If it is, it adds the difference between the two prices to `max_profit` (`max_profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1]`).
- After finishing the iteration through all the prices, it returns the `max_profit`.

### Elaborate Examples

```python
# Example 1:
prices1 = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]  # The input array of prices.
# Day 1: Do nothing because there is no previous price to compare.
# Day 2: Buy at price 1.
# Day 3: Sell at price 5. Profit = 4.
# Day 4: Do nothing (price went down).
# Day 5: Buy at price 3.
# Day 6: Sell at price 6. Profit = 3.
# Total Profit = 4 + 3 = 7.
# Expected output: 7

# Example 2:
prices2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Prices are continuously rising.
# The optimal strategy is to buy on day 1 and sell on day 5.
# However, this is equivalent to buying on day 1 and selling on day 2, buying on day 2 and selling on day 3, and so on.
# Total Profit = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 (each day's profit is 1).
# Expected output: 4
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the `prices` array. We iterate through the array once.

Space complexity: O(1), because we only used a constant amount of extra space (for the max_profit variable).

### Real-World Applications

This algorithm can be viewed as a simplified model for algorithmic trading where the transaction costs are omitted. Although real-world trading is far more complex, understanding the basics of maximizing profits through transaction sequences is essential in financial markets.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Not accounting for the possibility of continuous transactions: One must realize that multiple separate profitable transactions can have the same effect as holding a stock for a long duration.
- Misunderstanding the problem by thinking you need to find the single best day to buy and the single best day to sell. Rather, the goal is to accumulate profits over the course of multiple transactions.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem can be categorized within the ""greedy algorithm"" problems. It does not require keeping track of previous states (unlike in dynamic programming) as decisions can be based solely on the current and the next step's data.

123,"LeetCode Problem 123 is titled ""Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III,"" which is part of a series of problems about buying and selling stocks to maximize profit. Here's a detailed breakdown of the problem and its various aspects:

### Problem Statement:
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing different days in the future to sell that stock. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note that you cannot engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

### Constraints:
- The number of days `n` is such that `1 <= n <= 10^5`.
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^5`.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The problem asks to determine the maximum profit that can be made with up to two non-overlapping transactions. That means you can buy and sell once, and then again buy and sell once more, but the second buying must be after the first selling.

The challenge here is that we need to determine the optimal points in time to carry out these transactions. This is a dynamic programming problem because you're being asked to make a sequence of decisions that depend on previous decisions (i.e., you cannot decide to sell on day X without considering if you should have bought on a previous day Y).

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
The problem requires a dynamic approach because trying to solve it through simple iteration or brute force would result in an exponential time complexity, which is not feasible for large input sizes. The idea is to split the problem into simpler subproblems and to store the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

A popular dynamic programming solution involves tracking four variables that represent the states after each transaction:
1. The maximum profit after buying the first stock.
2. The maximum profit after selling the first stock.
3. The maximum profit after buying the second stock.
4. The maximum profit after selling the second stock.

We iterate through the prices array and update these four variables.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:
The Python code for this problem could look like the following:

```python
def maxProfit(prices):
    # Initialization of the four required states.
    first_buy, first_sell = float('-inf'), 0
    second_buy, second_sell = float('-inf'), 0

    for price in prices:
        first_buy = max(first_buy, -price)          # We ""buy"" the stock, so we subtract the price.
        first_sell = max(first_sell, first_buy + price) # We sell the stock at the current price.
        # For the second transaction, we treat the profit from the first sell as an offset.
        second_buy = max(second_buy, first_sell - price) 
        second_sell = max(second_sell, second_buy + price) # Similar to the first sell.

    # The answer is the maximum profit after the second sell.
    return second_sell
```

In this code:
- `first_buy` is initialized to negative infinity to represent that we haven't bought any stock yet.
- `first_sell` starts at 0 since we have made no profit at the beginning.
- As we iterate through each price, we calculate the maximum of `first_buy` and `-price` to represent the profit loss of buying a stock (notice we use `-price` since we're spending money).
- `first_sell` represents the maximum of its current value and `first_buy + price`, which is the profit we make by selling at the current price minus the cost when we bought the stock.
- `second_buy` takes into account the profit we already made from the first sell and subtracts the current price, which is essentially buying a second stock using some of our first profits.
- `second_sell` is the total profit after doing the second transaction.

### Elaborate Examples:
Let's walk through an example:

Given the prices `[3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]`, the function would work as follows:
- Start with `first_buy = -inf`, `first_sell = 0`, `second_buy = -inf`, `second_sell = 0`.
- Iterate through prices:
  - Day 1 (`price = 3`): `first_buy` becomes `-3`, `first_sell` remains `0` because selling now doesn't make profit.
  - Day 2 (`price = 3`): No changes since prices are the same as day 1.
  - Day 3 (`price = 5`): `first_sell` becomes `2`.
  - Day 4 (`price = 0`): Now `first_buy` is `-0` because we can buy at 0, and `second_buy` becomes `2`.
  - Day 5 (`price = 0`): No change since price is still 0.
  - Day 6 (`price = 3`): `second_sell` becomes `5`.
  - Day 7 (`price = 1`): `second_buy` becomes `1`.
  - Day 8 (`price = 4`): `second_sell` becomes `6`.

  The maximum profit is `6` after the second sell.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of days. This is because we iterate through the price array only once. The space complexity is O(1), as we only maintain a constant number of variables regardless of the input size.

### Real-World Applications:
This problem has direct applications in financial markets where algorithmic trading systems decide on buying and selling stocks to maximize profit. The problem abstracts the core challenge of such systems in terms of finding optimal points to perform transactions.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- A common mistake is to try and use a greedy approach to simply pick the best two days to buy and sell. However, this doesn't work because the two transactions are not independent; the second buy must occur after the first sell.
- Another pitfall is not considering the case where no transactions are made, which is already covered by initializing the first_sell and second_sell to 0 (i.e., zero profit).
  
### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem is a classic example of dynamic programming, specifically of state machine type problems where you are tracking the state of an entity over time.

### Links to Similar Problems:

- 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (simple case with only one transaction allowed)

Each of these variations requires different tweaks to the dynamic programming approach used for problem 123 but build on the same fundamental concepts."
124,"LeetCode Problem 124 is titled ""Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum."" This problem is classified under the Hard difficulty category. Let's begin by dissecting the problem statement and understanding what it asks for in depth.

## Problem Statement

Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.

A path sum is the sum of the node values in a path.

## Extensive Problem Breakdown

In the context of binary trees, a ""path"" is a sequence of connected nodes where no node is revisited. Here, we have to identify a path where the sum of the values of the nodes in that path is as large as possible. This path:

- Can start and end at any node in the tree.
- Can go downwards, upwards (through the parent), or switch directions by passing through a common ancestor.
- Does not need to pass through the root of the tree.
- Must contain at least one node.

It's important to note that the values of the nodes can be positive or negative, which adds complexity to the problem, as it means that sometimes not including a node with a negative value could lead to a higher path sum.

## In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem efficiently, we use a recursive approach, where at each node we consider four possibilities:

1. The maximum path sum including the current node only.
2. The maximum path sum including the current node and extending to the left child.
3. The maximum path sum including the current node and extending to the right child.
4. The maximum path sum passing through the current node and including both children.

The recursive function will do two things:
- It computes the maximum path sum with the current node as the highest point (meaning that this path can be extended to include the parent).
- It updates the global maximum path sum if the current path is the highest so far (this path cannot be extended to include the parent because it includes both children).

We need to manage a global variable to keep track of the maximum path sum encountered during the traversal, as the maximum path sum may not pass through the root and thus cannot be returned as a single value from the recursive call.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation

Below is a possible Python solution for this problem. We'll go through the code line by line after presenting the full solution.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def max_gain(node):
            nonlocal max_sum
            if not node:
                return 0
            # Recursively call max_gain on node's left and right children
            left_gain = max(max_gain(node.left), 0)
            right_gain = max(max_gain(node.right), 0)
            
            # Price to keep the current node and potentially start a new path
            price_newpath = node.val + left_gain + right_gain
            
            # Update max_sum if it's better to start a new path
            max_sum = max(max_sum, price_newpath)
            
            # For recursion : return the max gain if continue the same path
            return node.val + max(left_gain, right_gain)
        
        max_sum = float('-inf')
        max_gain(root)
        return max_sum
```

Let's break down the key parts of the code:

1. We define a helper function `max_gain` which determines the maximum gain from any given node.
2. We use the concept of ""gain"" to decide whether to include a subtree in our path. The gain is the maximum sum we can obtain from this node including the node itself and optionally one of its subtrees. If adding a subtree results in a negative gain, we take 0 instead, effectively not including the subtree in the path.
3. The `max_gain` function is called recursively for the left and right children of a node. We also ensure that the recursive call does not return a negative gain, by using the `max(max_gain(node.left), 0)` and `max(max_gain(node.right), 0)` constructs.
4. The `price_newpath` variable holds the sum of the current node value and its left and right max gains, which represents the maximum path sum for a path starting at the current node and going downwards.
5. We have a global variable `max_sum` that is updated to store the maximum path sum found so far across all nodes processed.
6. Finally, we return `node.val + max(left_gain, right_gain)` so that the parent call can use the larger of the gains from the children nodes.

## Elaborate Examples

Consider the following binary tree:

```
      -10
      /  \
     9    20
          / \
         15  7
```

Here, the maximum path sum is 42, which is obtained by the path `15 -> 20 -> 7`.

- Starting at leaf nodes 9, 15, and 7, the maximum path sum at each of these nodes is just their value as they have no children.
- At node 20, the `max_gain` sees it can take both children (since both are positive), so it calculates `price_newpath = 20 + 15 + 7 = 42`. `max_sum` is updated to 42.
- At node -10, it excludes left gain (since 9 is less than the right side sum), so `price_newpath = -10 + 20 + 0 = 10`. Since 42 is still the largest, `max_sum` remains unchanged.

## Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once during our recursive traversal.

The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case, if the tree is skewed, the height of the tree can be N, leading to O(N) space complexity. In a balanced tree, the space complexity will be O(log N).

## Real-World Applications

Finding a maximum path in a structure can relate to many real-world problems, like finding the most profitable path for network traffic in telecommunication, optimizing roads between cities for transportation networks, or for finding the most valuable sequence in hierarchical systems.

## Common Pitfalls and Tricks

When implementing the recursive solution, it's important to keep in mind the base case (when the node is `None`). Additionally, handling negative nodes can be tricky; one must ensure that negative sums do not decrease the result of the max path sum, which is why we compare with zero when returning the recursive result.

## Pattern Identification

This problem is an example of tree depth-first search (DFS) where a global state (the maximum path sum) is maintained, and recursion is used to explore all possible paths. Identifying this pattern is useful in solving other tree-related problems, especially those that require processing nodes with a global context or aggregating information as recursion unwinds.

125,"LeetCode Problem 125 is titled ""Valid Palindrome."" Below is a comprehensive analysis of the problem statement, solution strategies, Python code, examples, complexity analysis, and additional context:

**Extensive Problem Breakdown:**
The problem asks us to determine if a string is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases. Anything that is not an alphanumeric character should be ignored in our palindrome check. This implies that the string should read the same forward and backward when we only look at the alphanumeric characters.

A key subtle nuance here is that we must ignore any character that is not alphanumeric—letters and numbers—and also ignore the case differences between characters. For example, ""A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"" is a valid palindrome after removing the non-alphanumeric characters and ignoring the case, it reads ""amanaplanacanalpanama"" both forward and backward.

**In-Depth Solution Rationale:**
There are several approaches to solve this problem, and here are a few:

1. **Two-Pointer Approach:**
   Initialize two pointers at the beginning and the end of the string. Move both pointers towards each other, skipping non-alphanumeric characters. At each step, compare the characters if both are alphanumeric. If at any point the characters don't match, return `False`. If the pointers cross each other, then every character has been checked, and the string is a palindrome, thus return `True`.

2. **String Reversal and Comparison:**
   Filter the string to remove all non-alphanumeric characters and convert it to the same case (either upper or lower). Then compare the filtered string with its reverse. If they are the same, the string is a palindrome.

Option 1 is generally more efficient because it does not require building a new string and only iterates over each character at most once, while Option 2 may require additional space and time to create the reversed string. Therefore, the two-pointer approach is generally preferred.

**Detailed Python Code Explanation:**
Here's a Python function to solve the problem using the two-pointer approach:

```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        # Move left pointer to the next alphanumeric character
        while left < right and not s[left].isalnum():
            left += 1
        # Move right pointer to the previous alphanumeric character
        while left < right and not s[right].isalnum():
            right -= 1
        # Compare characters
        if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower():
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True
```

The `isalnum()` method checks whether a character is alphanumeric, and the `lower()` method converts a character to lowercase. The two `while` loops inside the main loop skip non-alphanumeric characters. When both pointers point to alphanumeric characters, a case-insensitive comparison is done. If the comparison is not equal, the function returns `False`. If the entire string passes this check, `True` is returned.

**Elaborate Examples:**
- Example 1: `is_palindrome(""A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"")` should return `True`.
- Example 2: `is_palindrome(""race a car"")` should return `False` because when the non-alphanumeric characters are removed, the string ""raceacar"" is not the same read backward.
- Example 3: `is_palindrome("""")` should return `True` because an empty string is considered a palindrome.

**Thorough Complexity Analysis:**
The two-pointer approach has the following complexities:

- Time Complexity: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string, since each character is checked at most once.
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`, as we are not using any additional storage; we're merely moving pointers through the original string.

**Real-World Applications:**
The concept of determining palindromes can be used in different areas, including:
- text editors or programs involved in text analysis;
- in computational biology, where the sequence of DNA might be checked as a palindrome;
- data validation, where certain strings or numbers must read the same both ways.

**Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:**
A common pitfall in such problems is not accounting for case sensitivity and non-alphanumeric characters. When ignoring cases and non-alphanumeric characters, it's vital to move the pointers correctly and compare characters correctly.

Furthermore, it's a good practice to handle edge cases such as empty strings or strings with only non-alphanumeric characters.

**Problem Pattern Identification:**
This problem follows the two-pointer pattern which is often employed for array and string manipulation problems. Recognizing this pattern can help solve a wide variety of similar problems involving comparing elements from opposite ends of a collection.

126,"LeetCode problem number 126 is ""Word Ladder II"". This problem is a follow-up to ""Word Ladder"" and poses an additional challenge. Here's a detailed breakdown of the problem:

## Extensive Problem Breakdown:

In ""Word Ladder II"", you are given two words `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a list of words `wordList`. The task is to find all the shortest transformation sequences from `beginWord` to `endWord` such that:

- Only one letter can be changed at a time.
- Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that `beginWord` is not a part of the word list.
- Each sequence must be as short as possible, and you need to return all such sequences.

The subtleties in this problem lie in the constraints and the requirement to find all possible paths that are of the shortest possible length. Unlike the ""Word Ladder"", where you only need to find the shortest path length, here you must enumerate the actual paths.

## In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm is a natural choice as it can find the shortest path in a graph. However, since we need to find all shortest paths rather than just one, this problem requires storing additional information during the search.

A common approach is to use a BFS to build a tree-like structure storing all paths that lead to the endWord. We then perform a depth-first search (DFS) to reconstruct all these paths from the tree structure. 

### Solution Strategy:

1. **BFS Phase:** Starting from `beginWord`, perform a breadth-first search. Keep track of the tree-like structure mentioned above, where each word points back to all words that can transform into it in one step. This is essential to reconstruct the paths later.
   
2. **DFS Phase:** Once the BFS is completed and we've found the `endWord`, perform a depth-first search from `endWord` to `beginWord`, tracing back through the tree-like structure to recover all the shortest paths.

During the BFS, it's important to note that:

- We have to minimize the number of words we visit in order to reduce time complexity. We do this by generating all possible transformations of a current word and checking if they are in the `wordList`. To speed up the checking process, we can use a set instead of a list.
  
- We must avoid visiting the same word more than once, as this would create loops and inefficient paths. To ensure uniqueness, words that have already been visited are removed from the `wordList` or marked as visited.

Moreover, when we reach the `endWord`, we don't stop the BFS immediately. Instead, we finish the current level to ensure that we have found all the shortest paths.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's write the code step by step considering the above strategy. After writing the code, I'll break down each part of it providing a line-by-line explanation.

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def findLadders(beginWord, endWord, wordList):
    if endWord not in wordList:
        return []

    # Create a set for faster look-up and get word length
    wordSet = set(wordList)
    wordLength = len(beginWord)
    layer = {}
    layer[beginWord] = [[beginWord]]  # Starting point for BFS

    while layer:
        newLayer = defaultdict(list)
        for word in layer:
            if word == endWord:
                return layer[word]  # Found the shortest paths to endWord
            for i in range(wordLength):
                for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
                    nextWord = word[:i] + c + word[i+1:]
                    if nextWord in wordSet:
                        newLayer[nextWord] += [j + [nextWord] for j in layer[word]]
        
        # Remove visited words to prevent cycles and duplicates
        wordSet -= set(newLayer.keys())
        layer = newLayer
    
    return []
```

Now let's break it down:

- We start by checking if `endWord` is in `wordList`; if it's not, there's no possible transformation, so we return an empty list.
  
- We convert `wordList` to a set (`wordSet`) to make look-up operations constant time.

- We create a `layer` dict, which holds each word and all possible sequences that can reach that word. Initially, it only contains `beginWord`.

- The `while` loop represents the BFS. For each word in the current layer, we attempt to change each letter to all possible alphabets (`'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`) and check if the new word (`nextWord`) is in the `wordSet`.

- If we find the `endWord`, we return all sequences stored in `layer[endWord]`.

- For every valid `nextWord`, we append it to all sequences leading to the current `word`, forming new sequences that are added to `newLayer[nextWord]`.

- After we finish the current layer, we subtract the found words of `newLayer` from `wordSet` to avoid revisiting them, and then update `layer` to `newLayer` for the next iteration.

- If we exit the `while` loop without finding `endWord`, no valid transformation exists, so we return an empty list.

## Elaborate Examples:

Let's take an example:

```plaintext
beginWord = ""hit""
endWord = ""cog""
wordList = [""hot"",""dot"",""dog"",""lot"",""log"",""cog""]
```

1. Start with ""hit"". Possible one-letter transformations are ""hot"".
2. From ""hot"", possible transformations are ""dot"" and ""lot"".
3. From ""dot"", we reach ""dog"", and from ""lot"", we reach ""log"".
4. Finally, both ""dog"" and ""log"" can transform to ""cog"".

All sequences leading to ""cog"" are `[""hit"", ""hot"", ""dot"", ""dog"", ""cog""]` and `[""hit"", ""hot"", ""lot"", ""log"", ""cog""]`.

## Thorough Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N * L * 26)` where `N` is the number of words in the word list and `L` is the length of each word. For each word, we try `L` possible single-letter transformations, and each transformation involves iterating over 26 possible characters.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(N * L * W_path)` where `W_path` is the length of the longest path. We store sequences of words in the layers, and each sequence could be as long as the word path length.

## Real-World Applications:

This algorithm could be used in real-world applications involving the transformation of data in stages where each stage must follow specific rules. Examples include genetic algorithms, compiler design for optimizing intermediate code, and AI in games for pathfinding.

## Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- A common pitfall is to stop the BFS as soon as the `endWord` is found. This would not ensure all shortest paths are discovered.
  
- A trick to avoid unnecessary work is to remove words that have been visited in the current BFS layer to avoid cycles and revisitations.

- Another tip is to use a set for the word list to achieve constant-time look-ups.

## Problem Pattern Identification:

The problem follows the ""Breadth-First Search"" pattern for finding the shortest path and a ""Backtracking/Depth-First Search"" pattern to reconstruct all paths.

127,"LeetCode Problem #127 is titled ""Word Ladder"" and it falls under the categories of Graphs, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Hash Table. Let's break down the problem statement, discuss in detail the strategies to solve it, and analyze the solution in terms of its Python implementation and complexity.

### Problem Breakdown
The problem statement is as follows:

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a list of words `wordList`, return the length of the shortest transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`, such that:
- Only one letter can be changed at a time.
- Each transformed word must exist in the word list.

It is important to note the following:
- Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
- All the words have the same length.
- All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
- You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
- `beginWord` is not a part of the word list.
- If there are multiple such sequences, you only need to return the length of the shortest one.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
The problem essentially describes a shortest-path problem in the space of words, which can be viewed as vertices of a graph, where edges connect words that are one-letter apart. The most effective strategy to find the shortest path in such a graph is through BFS.

#### BFS Approach
Breadth-First Search works in this scenario because it explores neighbors of a node level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found before any longer paths are considered. Thus, as soon as the `endWord` is reached, we can be sure that the path used to get there is the shortest possible.

The algorithm steps are:
1. Initialize a queue with the `beginWord` and a step counter set to 1 (since `beginWord` is the starting word, the first step is already taken).
2. While the queue is not empty:
   a. For each word in the queue, generate all possible words that are one-letter apart.
   b. Check if any of these generated words are the `endWord`. If so, return the step counter.
   c. Otherwise, add the generated words that are in the word list to the queue.
   d. Increment the step counter.
3. Return 0 if the `endWord` is not reachable.

#### Optimization – Avoiding Revisited Words
When we visit a word and explore all of its adjacent words, we should mark it as visited to avoid revisits, which could lead to cycles and hence infinite loops. This marking can be done by removing the visited word from `wordList` or by keeping a separate set of visited words.

#### Word Generation Optimization
Rather than checking all other words in the list to find those one letter apart, we can generate all possible one-letter variations of each word and check if they are in `wordList`. This significantly speeds up the lookup process, especially when the word list is large.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation
The Python code for BFS implementation would look something like this:

```python
from collections import deque

def ladderLength(beginWord, endWord, wordList):
    wordList = set(wordList)  # Convert to a set for O(1) lookups
    queue = deque([(beginWord, 1)])  # Initialize queue with beginWord and steps counter

    while queue:
        word, steps = queue.popleft()  # Get the next word to explore and the steps taken so far
        if word == endWord:
            return steps

        # Generate all possible one-letter variations of the word
        for i in range(len(word)):
            for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
                next_word = word[:i] + c + word[i+1:]
                if next_word in wordList:
                    queue.append((next_word, steps + 1))
                    wordList.remove(next_word)  # Remove from the word list to prevent revisits
                    
    return 0
```

### Elaborate Examples
Consider an example:
```python
beginWord = ""hit""
endWord = ""cog""
wordList = [""hot"", ""dot"", ""dog"", ""lot"", ""log"", ""cog""]
```

The BFS approach would start with `""hit""` and then explore `""hot""` in the next step since it is only one character different. It then adds `""dot""` and `""lot""` to the queue and continues this pattern until `""cog""` is found.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: The time complexity is O(M×N), where `M` is the length of each word and `N` is the total number of words in the input `wordList`. This is because generating all possible words that are one-letter apart from a given word takes O(M), and we could do this for each word in the worst case (N).
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is also O(M×N), because in the worst case, we might need to hold all words in the queue simultaneously, plus storing the words in `wordList` as a set.

### Real-World Applications
The word ladder problem can be viewed as a proxy for various real-world problems, such as solving puzzles, making connections between concepts (semantic networks in AI), genetics (finding mutation paths), and network routing.

### Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks
- Not converting wordList to a set might lead to TLE because the lookups would be O(N) each.
- Forgetting to remove or mark words as visited after exploring them could lead to cycles and stack overflow errors (in a recursive approach).
- Overlooking the preprocessing step that checks if the endWord is in the wordList can result in unnecessary computation.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This problem introduces the pattern of transformation using BFS, which is a common approach to solve shortest path problems in discrete, non-weighted graphs.

128,"LeetCode problem number 128 is ""Longest Consecutive Sequence"". This problem is all about finding the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. Below is the problem description along with an exhaustive explanation.

### Problem Description
Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, you need to return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

### Example
```
Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

### Constraints
- `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

### Solution Strategy
The key insight to solve this problem in `O(n)` complexity is to use a Hash Table (which in Python is implemented as a `dict`). The traditional sorting approach would take `O(nlogn)` due to the sort operation, which does not meet the complexity requirement.

#### Steps
1. Insert all the numbers from the array into a `set` to eliminate duplicates and to allow `O(1)` lookups.
2. Iterate over each number in the `nums` array and for each number that is the start of a new sequence (i.e., the number that doesn't have its previous number in the set), start counting the length of the sequence by incrementing a counter while the consecutive numbers are in the set.
3. Update the maximum length found so far.

### Python Code Explanation
```python
def longestConsecutive(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    num_set = set(nums)
    max_length = 0

    for num in num_set:
        # Check if it's the start of a sequence
        if num - 1 not in num_set:
            current_num = num
            current_length = 1

            # Count the length of the sequence
            while current_num + 1 in num_set:
                current_num += 1
                current_length += 1

            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)

    return max_length
```

In this code:
- We first check for an edge case where `nums` is empty, in which case we return 0 as there can't be any sequence.
- We then convert the list `nums` to a `set` for efficient look-ups.
- Then, we iterate through each number in this set, using it as the potential start of a new sequence.
- The inner `while` loop keeps incrementing `current_length` while the consecutive sequence continues. This only happens if the current number being checked is indeed the start of a new sequence (hence the `if num - 1 not in num_set` check).
- `max_length` is updated with the maximum value between the current `max_length` and the `current_length` obtained for the current sequence.
- Finally, we return `max_length` as the result.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(n). Although there are two nested loops, the inner loop runs at most n times in total, because it only runs for consecutive starting points. Each number is part of exactly one sequence.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n). We use a set to store the elements of `nums`.

### Real-World Applications
This problem can represent real-world scenarios where you need to find continuous ranges or sequences from a dataset. This can apply to date ranges, event logs, or any scenario where contiguous data is relevant.

### Common Pitfalls and Tips
- Avoid the mistake of trying to sort the array which would result in a higher time complexity.
- Be mindful about the edge case where the input array is empty.

### Similar Problems and Pattern Recognition
This problem is an instance of sequence computation and hash table utilization. Similar problems might involve finding the length of a subarray satisfying certain conditions or identifying unbroken sequences of numbers or events.

While these problems have different constraints and requirements, they involve similar strategies concerning the use of hashsets/hashmaps and requiring efficient solutions that avoid unnecessary sorting or nested iterations. Understanding the use of sets and maps is crucial for solving such problems efficiently."
129,"LeetCode Problem 129 is titled ""Sum Root to Leaf Numbers"". This problem is a classic example of a tree traversal problem with a specific computation on the paths from root to leaf. Let's break down the problem in detail, describe the solution strategies, and analyze their complexities.

### Problem Statement
You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from `0` to `9` only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

- For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.
  
The task is to return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. A leaf node is a node with no children.

### Constraints
1. The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
2. `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
3. The depth of the tree will not exceed `10`.

### Solution Strategy
The primary approach to solving this problem is to perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the tree. At each node, we need to build the number represented by the path from the root to the current node. When we reach a leaf node, we add the number represented by that path to a running total.

Here's a high-level overview of the steps:

1. Start a recursive DFS function from the root node, with an initial current number of 0.

2. At each node, update the current number to incorporate the node's value. This is often done by shifting the current number to the left by one digit (multiply by 10) and then adding the node's value.

3. If the current node is a leaf (no children), add the current number to the total sum.

4. Recursively call the function for the left and right children if they exist.

5. Once all paths have been explored, return the sum.

### Python Code Explanation
Now, let's write the Python code for this solution and break it down:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def sumNumbers(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def dfs(node, current_sum):
            if not node:
                return 0
            current_sum = current_sum * 10 + node.val
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                return current_sum
            return dfs(node.left, current_sum) + dfs(node.right, current_sum)
        
        return dfs(root, 0)
```

### Breakdown of the code:

- `TreeNode` is the class definition for a node in the binary tree.

- In the `Solution` class, `sumNumbers` is the method that takes the root of the tree and returns the total sum.

- The `dfs` function is defined inside `sumNumbers`. It takes a `node` and the `current_sum` as arguments.

- The initial check `if not node:` is to handle the base case where the node is `None`.

- The `current_sum` is updated by multiplying it by 10 (to shift left by one digit) and then adding the node's value.

- If we reach a node that is a leaf (both left and right children are `None`), we return the `current_sum`.

- Otherwise, we recursively call the `dfs` function for the left and right children, if they exist, and return the sum of the values returned by these calls.

- Finally, we initiate the DFS traversal by calling `dfs(root, 0)` and return its result.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Because we are traversing each node exactly once.

- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This space is used by the recursion stack. In the worst case, if the tree is skewed, the height of the tree can be N.

### Edge Cases / Pitfalls To Consider
- Single node tree: Make sure the code correctly handles a tree with only one node.
- Handling large numbers: As the depth increases, the numerical value can get large, but within the constraints given, this should not be an issue.
- Make sure the base cases in recursion are correctly implemented to avoid infinite loops or stack overflow.

130,"LeetCode problem number 130 is titled ""Surrounded Regions"". Let's dive into a detailed analysis of this problem.

### Problem Statement
Given an `m x n` board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

Surrounded regions shouldn’t be on the boarder, which means that any 'O' on the boarder of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the boarder and it is not connected to an 'O' on the boarder will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

### Clarifications
- ""m"" represents the number of rows in the board.
- ""n"" represents the number of columns in the board.
- It is guaranteed that the board has at least one row and one column.

### Example
Consider the following board:
```
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
```

After running your function, the board should be:
```
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```

### In-Depth Solution Rationale
The problem can be approached in several ways, but one of the most intuitive methods is to perform a depth-first search (DFS) from the 'O's on the border since any 'O' reachable from them cannot be surrounded completely by 'X's and thus should not be flipped.

#### Steps for a Possible Solution
1. Iterate over the first and last column and the first and last row. For every 'O' encountered, perform a DFS to mark all 'O's connected to these edge 'O's.
2. During the DFS, we can mark the 'O's as a temporary marker such as 'E', indicating that these 'O's are on the edge and are not to be flipped.
3. After marking all edge-connected 'O's, iterate over the entire board and perform two actions:
   - Flip all marked 'E's back to 'O's since they are not surrounded.
   - Flip all remaining 'O's to 'X's as they are surrounded by 'X's.
   
This approach hinges on the key insight that any 'O' connected to the border directly or indirectly cannot be surrounded, and thus we only need to check and mark those to avoid flipping them later.

Let's break down the typical DFS function implementation for this problem:

```python
def solve(board):
    if not board or not board[0]:
        return

    def dfs(i, j):
        if i < 0 or i >= len(board) or j < 0 or j >= len(board[0]) or board[i][j] != 'O':
            return
        # Mark the current 'O' as part of the edge-connected region
        board[i][j] = 'E'
        # Explore the neighbors
        dfs(i, j + 1)
        dfs(i, j - 1)
        dfs(i + 1, j)
        dfs(i - 1, j)

    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in [0, len(board[0]) - 1]:  # Only first and last column
            if board[i][j] == 'O':
                dfs(i, j)
                
    for j in range(len(board[0])):
        for i in [0, len(board) - 1]:  # Only first and last row
            if board[i][j] == 'O':
                dfs(i, j)

    # Flip all 'E's back to 'O', and all other 'O's to 'X'
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[i][j] == 'E':
                board[i][j] = 'O'
            elif board[i][j] == 'O':
                board[i][j] = 'X'
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: The DFS runs in O(mn), where m and n are the dimensions of the board because, in the worst-case scenario, we may have to explore the entire board. There are O(mn) cells and each cell is visited at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: Since we're using recursion for DFS, the space complexity is also O(mn) due to the call stack in the worst case, where the entire board is filled with 'O's and we perform DFS on them. However, the space complexity could be reduced by using an iterative approach with an explicit stack.

### Real-World Applications
This kind of problem models situations where you need to determine connected components or regions within a grid or network and manipulate them according to certain rules. It has direct applications in image processing (e.g., ""flood fill"" algorithms), game development (for territory capture mechanics), and even geographical information systems for identifying enclosed regions.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks
- Remember to check for an empty board or rows as the first condition.
- Be mindful of array bounds when performing DFS. It's easy to mistakenly access out-of-bounds indices.
- The marking of 'O's as 'E's during DFS is crucial to avoid infinite loops and correctly identifying edge-connected 'O's.

### Problem Pattern Identification
This falls under the category of DFS (Depth-First Search) problems, especially dealing with graph traversal on a grid. Recognizing that we can solve the problem by starting from the edges simplifies the solution rather than attempting to find surrounded areas starting from the center of the grid.

### Related LeetCode Problems
Similar problems involving DFS on grids include:
- 200. Number of Islands
- 695. Max Area of Island
- 733. Flood Fill

Each of these problems requires you to traverse a grid to determine certain regions or modify them according to certain rules, similar to what's required here. The skills learned in performing DFS and understanding when and where to begin traversal are directly applicable to these related challenges."
131,"LeetCode Problem 131 is ""Palindrome Partitioning"". This problem is about backtracking and recursion. Let's break down the problem in detail:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The problem reads as follows:
Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of `s`.

A palindrome is a word or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. The problem asks us to return all different ways we can split the given string into substrings that are individual palindromes.

For instance, if the input string is ""aab"", then the output should be `[[""aa"",""b""], [""a"",""a"",""b""]]`. This is because there are two ways to split the string where every substring is a palindrome. The substrings ""aa"" and ""b"" are both palindromes in the first case, and each character ""a"", ""a"", and ""b"" is a separate palindrome in the second case.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, we will approach it using backtracking. Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving recursive problems by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, and removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.

Here are the steps we would generally follow for this approach:

1. Start with an empty list of partitions and a starting index of 0.
2. Iterate over the string from the starting index to the end of the string.
3. For each index, check if the substring from the start index to the current index is a palindrome.
4. If it is a palindrome, add this substring to the current partition list and recursively call the function with the current list of partitions and the next index as the starting point.
5. If it is not a palindrome, continue to the next index.
6. When the starting index reaches the end of the string, add the current list of partitions to the result list as one of the possible partitionings.
7. Backtrack after each recursive call to remove the last added partition and try other possibilities.

For checking if a substring is a palindrome, we can write a helper function that takes the string and two indices (start and end) and checks if the substring is a palindrome by comparing characters from the outermost pair inward.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

In the next section, I will provide the Python code for this solution and explain each part of it.

### Elaborate Examples

After providing the code, we will also walk through a detailed example to see how the backtracking works step by step.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

We will analyze the time and space complexity based on the recursive calls and the number of potential partitions.

### Real-World Applications

Finding all partitions of a string that are palindromes is not just a theoretical problem but can be applied in areas such as natural language processing, data segmentation, and cryptography.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

We'll look into common mistakes, such as failing to properly backtrack, not correctly checking for palindromes, or having inefficiencies in the recursion.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The problem follows the backtracking pattern, which can also be identified in other similar problems like ""Combinations"" or ""Permutations"".

132,"LeetCode Problem 132, titled ""Palindrome Partitioning II,"" is a classic dynamic programming challenge. Let's break down every aspect of this problem to provide a comprehensive understanding and solution roadmap.

### Problem Statement:

You are given a string `s`, and the goal is to partition `s` into as few substrings as possible such that every substring is a palindrome.

Return the minimum number of cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of `s`.

### Understanding the Problem:

To solve this problem, you need to understand:

1. What a palindrome is: A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., ""radar"", ""level"".
2. What partitioning means: It refers to dividing the string into substrings. These substrings, when concatenated in the same order, will result in the original string.
3. That we're looking for the minimum cuts: This means we seek an optimal partition where the number of palindromic substrings is maximized, thereby minimizing the number of cuts.
4. A cut defines a place between two characters in the string where the string is divided. So if you have made 'n' cuts, you will end up with 'n+1' substrings.

### Examples:

- Example 1: If `s = ""aab""`, one of the optimal solutions is to cut between ""a"" and ""ab"", giving us ""a|ab"", and since ""a"" and ""ab"" are both palindromes, we have 1 cut total.
- Example 2: If `s = ""a""`, we don't need any cuts because ""a"" is already a palindrome.

### Solution Strategy:

This problem can be approached using dynamic programming. Here's the rationale:

1. We can create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents whether the substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome.
2. Then, we create a 1D array `cuts` where `cuts[i]` will be the minimum number of cuts needed to partition the string `s[:i+1]` into palindromic substrings.
3. We initialize `cuts[i]` with the worst case: `i` cuts which partition every character as a substring.
4. We populate `dp` using two pointers expanding around each center, checking for both even and odd length palindromes.
5. We iterate over each substring ending at index `i` and check if the substring starting from some index `j` to `i` (`s[j:i+1]`) is a palindrome. If it is, and if `j == 0`, then the whole substring `s[0:i+1]` is a palindrome, so no cut is needed; otherwise, we update `cuts[i]` with the minimum between its current value and one plus the number of cuts needed for `s[0:j]`, i.e., `cuts[i] = min(cuts[i], cuts[j-1] + 1)`.
6. The answer will be stored in `cuts[-1]`, which represents the minimum cuts for the whole string.

### Complexity Analysis:

Let's consider `n` as the length of the string `s`.

- Time Complexity: We have two nested loops to fill in the `dp` array and another two nested loops for computing `cuts`. This leads to `O(n^2)` time complexity for filling in `dp` and `O(n^2)` for computing `cuts`, resulting in an overall time complexity of `O(n^2)`.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is `O(n^2)` for the `dp` array and `O(n)` for the `cuts` array, totaling `O(n^2)`.

### Python Code Explanation:

I will now provide a detailed line-by-line Python code solution for this problem."
133,"LeetCode Problem 133 is titled ""Clone Graph."" The challenge is to create a deep copy of a graph. Before diving into the solution, let's break down the problem and understand its components.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of nodes (also known as vertices) and a set of edges that connect pairs of nodes. In most graph problems on LeetCode, the graph is represented using adjacency lists or adjacency matrices. In this problem, the graph is represented using nodes where each node contains a value and a list of its neighbors.

The input of the problem is a reference to a single node from a `connected,` `undirected` graph. You are asked to return a cloned copy of the graph.

A `deep copy` of a graph is a new graph where each node and edge is a copy of the nodes and edges of the original graph. In this deep copy, changing the properties of a node in the new graph should have no effect on the nodes of the original graph.

Here are some specific details to be aware of:
- Each node in the graph contains a value and a list of its neighbors.
- The value is an integer and uniquely identifies a node.
- The list of neighbors can be empty, indicating a node with no connected edges.
- You must return a deep copy of the entire graph, not just the input node.
- The input graph is guaranteed to be connected, so all nodes are reachable from the input node.
- The graph is undirected, meaning that if there is an edge between node A and node B, both nodes should consider the other as a neighbor.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To clone the graph, you'll need to traverse the original graph and create a copy of each node and its edges. There are generally two common ways to traverse a graph: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

You'll also need a way to keep track of the nodes you've already copied to avoid duplicating nodes in the cloned graph and to handle cycles within the graph. This is usually accomplished by using a hash table that maps original nodes to their clones.

#### DFS Approach

For a DFS approach, you can use recursion or a stack. The algorithm will look like this:
1. Start by creating a clone of the input node.
2. For each neighbor of the input node, check if a clone has already been created:
   - If not, create a clone and recursively deep copy its neighbors.
   - If a clone exists, then it means that we've already visited this node, and we can simply attach the clone to the neighbors of the cloned node.
3. Store the mapping from the original node to the cloned node in a hash table.
4. Continue this process until all nodes have been visited and copied.

#### BFS Approach

For a BFS approach, you would use a queue. The algorithm is similar to DFS, but instead of using recursion, you would:
1. Create a clone of the input node and add the original node to the queue.
2. While the queue is not empty, remove a node from the queue, and for each neighbor:
   - If a clone of the neighbor does not exist, create it, add the original neighbor to the queue, and attach the clone to the cloned node's neighbors.
   - If a clone exists, just attach it to the cloned node's neighbors.
3. As with DFS, use a hash table to keep track of the cloned nodes.
4. Continue this process until the queue is empty.

In both strategies, once all nodes have been processed, you will have a deep copy of the graph.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Here's how you could write the DFS approach in Python:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []

class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not node:
            return node
            
        old_to_new = {}  # This dictionary maps original nodes to their clones.

        # Helper function to perform DFS.
        def dfs(node):
            # If the node has already been copied, return the clone.
            if node in old_to_new:
                return old_to_new[node]
            
            # Copy the node.
            copy = Node(node.val)
            old_to_new[node] = copy
            
            # Recursively copy all neighbors.
            for neighbor in node.neighbors:
                copy.neighbors.append(dfs(neighbor))
            
            return copy
        
        # Start DFS from the input node and return the clone of the graph.
        return dfs(node)
```

In the above code, `old_to_new` is the hash table that keeps track of the original nodes and their corresponding clones. The `dfs` function is a helper function that performs the Depth-First Search and cloning process.

### Elaborate Examples

Consider an example graph represented with adjacency list as follows:

```
1 -- 2
|    |
4 -- 3
```

The input node could be the node with value `1`. The deep copy process in DFS would follow these steps:
- Clone node `1`, add it to `old_to_new` and process its neighbors (2 and 4).
- When processing node `2`, clone it, add it to `old_to_new` and process its neighbors (1 and 3).
- Node `1` is already in `old_to_new`, so link the cloned node `2` with the cloned node `1` instead of creating a new copy.
- Clone node `3`, add it to `old_to_new`, and link it to the clone of node `2`.
- Visit node `4`, which has not been cloned yet, clone it, and link it to the clone of node `1`.
- Node `3` is already in `old_to_new`, so link the cloned node `4` with the cloned node `3`.

The result is a deep copy of the input graph, with no references between the nodes in the original graph and the newly created graph.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

The time and space complexity for both DFS and BFS approaches are:

- Time Complexity: **O(N + M)**, where **N** is the number of nodes and **M** is the number of edges. Every node and edge is visited once.
- Space Complexity: **O(N)**, for storing the clone of each node. The recursive (DFS) or iterative (BFS) call stack or queue also uses space, but it does not exceed O(N) since the graph is guaranteed to be connected.

### Real-World Applications

Graph cloning can be particularly useful in scenarios where you need to perform operations or simulations on a graph without modifying the original graph. This can include scenarios such as:
- Social network analysis where you want to predict changes without affecting the current network.
- Genetic algorithms where the graph represents a solution, and you want to mutate the solution without changing the original.
- Performing ""what-if"" analyses where potential changes are tested on the clone rather than the actual data.
- Game development, where a game state represented by a graph can be cloned for AI decision trees and backtracking strategies.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Remember that in an undirected graph, each edge will appear twice in the adjacency list representation, once for each connected node.
- Be cautious of cycles in the graph. Without keeping track of the visited/cloned nodes, you could end up in an infinite loop.
- Forgetting to handle edge cases such as an empty graph (no nodes) or a graph with only one node could cause incorrect solutions or runtime errors.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem follows the Graph Traversal pattern, which is common in many problems that involve searching or analyzing the structure of graphs. Recognizing that you need to traverse a graph is key to solving similar problems.

- 210. Course Schedule II
- 994. Rotting Oranges

In each of these problems, graph traversal and tracking visited nodes play crucial roles in arriving at the solution, just as in Problem 133."
134,"LeetCode problem number 134 is titled ""Gas Station"". Here's an extensive breakdown of the problem:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem statement provides an interesting real-world scenario: there are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station `i` is `gas[i]`. You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from station `i` to its next station `(i+1)`. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations. The goal is to complete the circuit once, starting at a gas station and returning to it without running out of gas at any point during the journey. If this is possible, return the starting gas station's index; otherwise, return `-1`.

To clarify, the problem assumes the following:
- If the car starts at a gas station with enough gas to move to the next station, it can proceed.
- Moving from the last station loops back around to the first station, hence the circular route.
- The task is to find the smallest index of the starting gas station if such a tour is possible.

#### Subtle Nuances:

- The problem implicitly requires understanding if the circuit can be traversed completely with the available gas, without worrying about the gas remaining after the complete loop.
- It guarantees that the solution is unique if it exists, i.e., there will not be two different starting positions that both enable a complete loop.
- The question does not specify the behavior if all stations have exactly the same amount of `gas[i]` and `cost[i]`, although in such a scenario any start index would be a valid solution.
  
### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

The solution strategy involves checking whether there is more total gas than total cost. If not, it's impossible to complete the journey and we return `-1`. If it's possible, we need to find where to start.

There are two main approaches:
1. **Brute Force**: For each station, try to make a complete loop starting from that station, and if you succeed, return that station's index. However, this approach has a large time complexity, making it inefficient for large inputs.
2. **Single Pass (Optimal Solution)**: Traverse the stations and keep track of the total gas and cost. If at any point, your gas is less than the cost required to move to the next station, that means you cannot start from any of the previous stations. You need to start considering the next station as a potential start point. This solution is optimal because it requires only one pass through the data.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's implement the single pass method, which is the optimal solution:

```python
def canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost):
    if sum(gas) < sum(cost):  # If total gas is less than total cost, return -1.
        return -1
        
    start, total_gas, curr_gas = 0, 0, 0
    
    for i in range(len(gas)):
        total_gas += gas[i] - cost[i]
        curr_gas += gas[i] - cost[i]
        
        if curr_gas < 0:  # Can't reach the next station from current start
            start = i + 1  # Start at next station
            curr_gas = 0   # Reset current gas
    
    # If total gas >= total cost, it's guaranteed to complete the circuit.
    return start
```

Breakdown:
- `sum(gas) < sum(cost)`: We check if the total amount of gas is less than the total cost. If it is, we immediately return `-1` since it's impossible to complete the circuit.
- `start`: The variable that stores the index of the gas station from where we should start the journey for a successful complete loop.
- `total_gas` and `curr_gas`: Keep track of the total gas left and the current gas left after each station, respectively.
- The `for` loop iterates over each station.
- `total_gas += gas[i] - cost[i]` and `curr_gas += gas[i] - cost[i]`: These lines calculate the total gas left and current gas after visiting each station.
- Whenever `curr_gas` becomes negative, it means we can't start from the previous `start` index, so we set `start` to `i + 1` and reset `curr_gas` to 0.
- In the end, if `total_gas` is non-negative, we have a guarantee from the problem statement that the circuit can be completed if started from `start`.

### Elaborate Examples:

Imagine we have the following inputs:

```python
gas  = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
cost = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
```

- Starting at index 0, we have 1 gas, but cost is 3. We cannot move.
- Starting at index 1 or 2 is the same story; we don't have enough gas to move to next station.
- Starting at index 3, we move to index 4 having 3 units of gas (`4 - 1 = 3`), then we move to index 0 having 6 units of gas (`3 + 5 - 2 = 6`), and so on until we complete the circuit, thus index 3 is the answer.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

Time complexity:
- There is a single loop that iterates over all stations, thus the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of gas stations.

Space complexity:
- No extra space is used apart from a few variables to store the current gas, total gas, and starting index. Therefore, the space complexity is O(1).

### Real-World Applications:

The problem is a good representation of resource allocation and optimization in a circular workflow. In real-life scenarios such as supply chain logistics or network packet routing, figuring out the optimal starting point to ensure the complete processing of a task without running out of resources is valuable.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- One common pitfall is trying to solve the problem with brute force, which increases time complexity significantly.
- Another is not recognizing that if the total gas is less than the total cost, it is impossible to make the journey, leading to unnecessary calculations.
- A useful trick is that if a journey from A to B is not possible, then starting at any station between A and B will also not be possible. This simplifies the logic to reset the starting position.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem falls under the greedy algorithm pattern. A greedy algorithm builds up a solution piece by piece and decides which piece to add next based on which is the most attractive option at that moment (locally optimal choice). Here, if you run out of gas, you simply move the start point ahead greedily.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:

Here are some related problems on LeetCode that involve circular routes or require a greedy approach:

- **122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II**: A problem where you need to find the best times to buy and sell stocks to maximize profit within given constraints, which can be approached with a greedy algorithm.

- **45. Jump Game II**: This is a variation of Jump Game where you need to find the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index, and greedy methods can also be applied here.

Understanding and mastering the greedy approach in problem 134 ""Gas Station"" can provide valuable insights and techniques that may be applied to solve these related problems."
135,"LeetCode Problem 135 is called ""Candy"". Below is a comprehensive breakdown of various aspects of the problem including the problem statement, solution strategies, and analysis.

### Problem Statement

The Candy problem is a classical question that involves fair distribution while meeting certain constraints. Here's the problem statement:

There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in an integer array `ratings`. You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

The task is to calculate and return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children in a way that meets the requirements.

### Example

Input: ratings = [1, 0, 2]
Output: 5
Explanation:
- The child at index 0 gets 2 candies.
- The child at index 1 gets 1 candy.
- The child at index 2 gets 2 candies.
We have thus distributed 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 candies in total and we cannot use fewer candies and still meet our rating constraint.

### Subtle Nuances

- Notice that if two adjacent children have the same rating, they are allowed to have the same number of candies.
- The ratings are not necessarily unique which means you can have multiple children with the same rating.
- The rating criteria only apply to immediate neighbors, not to children further apart in the line.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The solution to the Candy problem can be broken down into the following key steps:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize an array, `candies`, to store the number of candies each child will get, with a size equal to the number of children, `n`, setting each element to 1 since every child gets at least one candy.

2. **Left to Right Scan**: Traverse the `ratings` array from left to right. If a child's rating is higher than the previous child's, give this child one more candy than the previous child by setting `candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1`.

3. **Right to Left Scan**: Traverse the `ratings` array from right to left. If a child's rating is higher than the next child's and the child does not already have more candies, give this child one more candy than the next child by setting `candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1)`.

4. **Sum Up Candies**: Sum up all the values in the `candies` array. This will give the minimum number of candies needed to satisfy the problem's constraints.

This approach works because it first ensures the rule that each child with a higher rating than the previous one gets more candies, and then it adjusts from the back to cover cases where a child has a higher rating than the next one.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's break down a Python implementation of the above logic:
```python
def candy(ratings):
    n = len(ratings)
    candies = [1] * n
    
    # Left to right scan
    for i in range(1, n):
        if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:
            candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1
    
    # Right to left scan
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]:
            candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1)
    
    # Summing up the candies for all children
    return sum(candies)
```

1. `candies = [1] * n`: All children are initialized to have 1 candy.
2. First `for` loop - left to right scan: If a child's rating is higher than the previous child's, they get one more candy than the `candies[i - 1]`.
3. Second `for` loop - right to left scan: If a child's rating is higher than the next child's and they have not already been given more candies from the left side, they get `max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1)`.
4. `return sum(candies)`: The total number of candies is determined by summing the `candies` array elements.

### Elaborate Examples

To ensure understanding, let's consider a few more examples:

Example 1:
ratings = [1, 2, 2]
Expected Output: 4
Explanation:
- The first child gets 1 candy.
- The second child gets 2 candies as their rating is higher.
- The third child gets 1 candy as its rating is the same as the second child's.

Example 2:
ratings = [1, 3, 4, 5, 2]
Expected Output: 11
Explanation:
- The first child gets 1 candy.
- The second child gets 2 candies.
- The third child gets 3 candies.
- The fourth child gets 4 candies.
- The fifth child gets 1 candy as its rating is less than the fourth child's.

### Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(n) where `n` is the number of children. This is because we traverse the `ratings` array only twice.

**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also O(n) due to the extra `candies` array that we use to store the candies for each child.

### Real-World Applications

The Candy problem is an abstraction of situations where resources must be allocated fairly and according to specific criteria, such as salary distribution, resource allocation, or academic grading.

### Potential Errors and Tips

A common mistake might be to use a greedy algorithm from just one direction, which will fail to satisfy the constraints for the opposite direction. Make sure to scan from both left to right and right to left.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem can be classified as a greedy algorithm problem. Recognizing that a local optimal solution leads to a global optimal solution helps in solving similar distribution or allocation problems.

Note that the problem guarantees certain conditions:
1. You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity, which means that the solution should have O(n) time complexity.
2. The problem statement also requires that you use only constant extra space, which rules out the use of additional data structures that grow with the input size.

To solve this problem, there are several approaches that one could consider. However, due to the constraints, we need to find an approach that uses O(n) time and O(1) space. Here are some potential methods:

1. **Use a `set` or `dict` to track appearances:** You could loop through the numbers and use a `set` or `dict` to track the numbers you've seen. If a number appears more than once, you would remove it. This would leave you with only the number that appears once at the end. This approach is straightforward but does not meet the space complexity requirement because the auxiliary data structure grows with the size of the input.

2. **Sort and iterate:** Another approach is to sort the array first and then iterate through the array looking for the unique element. This approach also fails the space complexity requirement, and sorting takes O(n log n) time, which exceeds the time complexity constraint.

3. **Bit manipulation (XOR):** The most suitable method for this problem is to use bitwise XOR. The XOR operation has a special property where a number XOR with itself is 0, and a number XOR with 0 is the number itself. Also, XOR is commutative and associative, which means the order of operations does not change the result.

Using this property, if you XOR all the numbers in the array together, the numbers that appear in pairs will cancel out (become 0), and you will be left with the unique number that only appears once.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Here's a Python function that uses the XOR approach to solve the problem:

```python
def singleNumber(nums):
    unique_num = 0
    for num in nums:
        unique_num ^= num
    return unique_num
```

Let's break down what's happening in the function:

- `unique_num` is initialized to `0`. It will store the cumulative XOR result.
- We then loop over each `num` in `nums` using a `for` loop.
- During each iteration, we perform XOR between `unique_num` and `num` using the `^` operator. This cumulative XOR operation ensures that pairs of the same element cancel out.
- Finally, `unique_num` will store only the unique number that isn't cancelled out, and we return this number.

### Elaborate Example:

Consider the array [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]. The XOR operation unfolds like this:

```
0 ^ 4 = 4
4 ^ 1 = 5
5 ^ 2 = 7
7 ^ 1 = 6
6 ^ 2 = 4
```

At the end, we are left with `4`, which is the number that appears only once in the array. 

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. We go through each element once during the single pass in the loop.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1), because we use a fixed amount of extra space (`unique_num`) regardless of the input size.

### Real-World Applications:

This problem could be applicable in real-world scenarios where you need to find unique occurrences among duplicates, such as:

- Identifying a unique visitor in a set of entrance and exit logs where every visitor signs in and out once and logs are unordered.
- Finding a non-repeating character in a string where all other characters repeat.
- Detecting a unique transmission signal in a set of paired signals, where each pair is identical with one unique outlier.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

One common pitfall is to ignore the power of XOR and attempt to solve this problem using additional data structures, leading to unnecessary complexity both in terms of code and space/time complexity.

A specific nuanced trick is to remember the commutative and associative properties of XOR, which allow you to apply the XOR operation in any order, providing flexibility in how you process the array.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem is an excellent example of a pattern where bit manipulation provides an elegant solution to a seemingly complex problem. Identifying the opportunity to use XOR can be a valuable insight when faced with other problems involving pairs of values or requirements for constant space solutions.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:

For further practice on bit manipulation and related concepts, you might consider the following problems from LeetCode:

- Problem 137: Single Number II
- Problem 260: Single Number III
- Problem 190: Reverse Bits
- Problem 191: Number of 1 Bits

These problems vary in difficulty but all involve understanding and applying bit manipulation techniques to successfully derive a solution."
137,"LeetCode Problem 137 is titled ""Single Number II."" This problem is a variation of the popular ""single number"" problem which typically requires finding a unique element among duplicates in a list. However, in this version of the problem, the situation is slightly tweaked. Here is the problem statement with an in-depth analysis.

**Problem Statement:**

Given an integer array `nums` where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99

The problem specifies that there is precisely one element in the array that is not repeated three times, and our task is to identify that element. The input is guaranteed to uphold this condition, which means you do not need to check for input validity or handle cases where there may be multiple such non-triplicated elements.

**In-Depth Solution Rationale:**

To solve this problem, we need a method that can single out the element that doesn’t adhere to the repeating pattern. Several approaches can be employed:

1. **Hash Table Approach:**
   - Traverse the entire array and keep a hash map (or dictionary in Python) to count the occurrences of each element.
   - Iterate through the hash map to find the element which has a count of one.
   - This approach takes O(n) time and O(n) space complexity.

2. **Sorting Approach:**
   - Sort the array first, which will bring the same elements together.
   - Iterate through the sorted array to identify the element that doesn't have two identical neighbors.
   - This approach has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting, and it uses O(1) additional space.

3. **Bit Manipulation (Optimized Approach):**
   - Realize that if you add the bits in each position for all numbers, the sum must be a multiple of 3, except for the bit from the single number.
   - Keep track of the count of bits at each position, modulo 3.
   - Construct the result from these counts.
   - This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and constant space complexity O(1).

The first two approaches are more straightforward but less efficient in terms of space or time complexity. The last approach, bit manipulation, utilizes the special property given in the problem and solves it very efficiently without requiring extra memory (apart from the fixed-sized bit counters).

**Bit Manipulation Solution Explanation:**

When every element except one appears exactly three times, it means if we convert all numbers to binary and count the number of 1s for each bit position across all numbers, every bit position in the binary representation should have the number of 1s that is a multiple of 3 (since each number that appears three times will contribute either 0 or 3 to the count). If a bit position has a count not a multiple of 3, the extra 1 comes from the unique number.

We will use three integer variables to keep track of the bits' occurrence count, let’s call these `ones`, `twos`, and `threes`. Here's the idea:

- `ones`: Holds the XOR result of all the elements that have appeared once.
- `twos`: Holds the XOR result of all the elements that have appeared twice.
- `threes`: Holds bits that have appeared three times.

In the end, the variable `ones` will represent the number that appears only once.

Let's work through an example and then provide the Python code:

Suppose nums = [2,2,3,2], in binary: [10, 10, 11, 10].

Let’s iterate through each bit position.
   
For the first bit (LSB), `2` contributes one 1 and `3` contributes one 1. Total four 1s, which is multiple of 3, so the LSB of the unique number is 0.
For the second bit, `2` contributes a 1 three times, but since we only need to count modulo 3, these all cancel each other out (sum up to 0 modulo 3). The `3`, however, contributes one 1, which is not canceled out. So, the second bit of the unique number is 1.

**Python Code Explanation:**

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        ones, twos = 0, 0
        for num in nums:
            ones = (ones ^ num) & ~twos
            twos = (twos ^ num) & ~ones
        return ones
```

- The first line in the loop, `ones = (ones ^ num) & ~twos`, captures the bits that have appeared for the first time (xor with `ones`) while avoiding the bits that have appeared a second time (`& ~twos`), essentially resetting `ones` where `twos` has a bit set.
- The second line, `twos = (twos ^ num) & ~ones`, is to capture bits that have appeared for the second time while avoiding the bits that have appeared a third time (now recorded in `ones`).
- Finally, `return ones` gives us the unique element.

**Complexity Analysis:**

- Time Complexity: We loop through all n elements of `nums` once, so the time complexity is O(n).
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a fixed number of integer variables.

**Real-World Applications:**

The bit manipulation techniques used in this problem are useful in low-level programming, such as embedded systems or performance-critical applications, where memory is limited. Understanding how to efficiently manipulate bits and perform operations like XOR and AND at the bit level can help optimize programs to run faster and use less memory.

**Common Pitfalls and Tricks:**

- Forgetting to consider every number appearing three times and thus mistakenly applying solutions appropriate for numbers appearing twice.
- Overlooking edge cases such as large arrays or arrays with negative integers. The solution above does handle these cases but it's a common oversight.
- Using data structures or algorithms that don’t leverage the specific pattern given in the problem, resulting in a less optimal solution.

**Problem Pattern Identification:**

The problem exhibits a pattern of ""counting occurrences modulo some number,"" a useful pattern for similar problems where you need to find unique or rare elements among many repeating ones. It also relies heavily on bit manipulation.

**Links to Similar Problems:**

Here are some related LeetCode problems where similar concepts of bit manipulation and finding unique elements in an array are utilized:

- Problem 136: Single Number (where every element appears twice except for one).
- Problem 260: Single Number III (where you need to find two elements that appear only once).
- Problem 191: Number of 1 Bits (counting the number of one bits in an integer).

In conclusion, understanding how to solve ""Single Number II"" enriches your toolbox with techniques involving bit manipulation and reinforces patterns related to unique element identification in arrays, which can be applied across a broad range of problem-solving scenarios."
138,"LeetCode problem number 138 is ""Copy List with Random Pointer"". This is a medium difficulty problem, and it requires a deep understanding of linked list data structures as well as cloning or copying complex data structures.

Here's an extensive problem breakdown:

### Problem Statement

The problem provides a linked list where each node has two pointers: one to the next node in the usual linear sequence of a linked list and another to any node in the list or null (referred to as the ""random pointer""). The task is to create a deep copy of the list; not just a new list with the same values, but a new list where each node is a new object with the same value and pointers to its own list's nodes just as the original.

### Subtle Nuances

- The random pointer for any node might point to any node in the list or none at all (null), which means the clone has to consider any possible connections rather than just the 'next' nodes.
- The values of the nodes are not necessarily unique, making it impossible to simply use the values to map original and cloned nodes.
- The list can potentially contain cycles because of the random pointers, and the solution has to be able to handle these without getting stuck in an infinite loop.
- The cloned list must be a deep copy, meaning changes to the original list should not affect the copied list, and vice versa.
- The problem specifies that we need to do it with `O(1)` space complexity, so we cannot utilize an extra map to keep track of the old and new nodes.

### Solution Strategy

A common approach to solving this problem is to iterate through the original list and perform the following steps:

1. **Inserting cloned nodes**: For each original node, create a corresponding cloned node and insert it directly after the original node. Thus, if the original list was `A → B → C`, it will become `A → A' → B → B' → C → C'`, where `A'`, `B'`, and `C'` are the new clones of `A`, `B`, and `C`.
  
2. **Setting random pointers**: Now that each original node `O` has its clone `O'` directly following it, we can set the random pointers easily. We set `O'`'s random pointer to be `O.random.next`. This works because `O.random` is some original node whose next pointer is pointing to the clone of the node that `O`'s random pointer is pointing to.

3. **Unweave the two lists**: Once all random pointers have been set, we need to separate the original and copied lists. This requires another pass through the list to adjust the `next` pointers, effectively creating two separate lists from the combined one.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

When it comes to implementation, let's break down the steps further before delving into the actual code.

We will need a helper function or a class method to iterate over the list and perform the cloning operations. We'll use the `Node` class provided by LeetCode, which typically looks like this:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = int(x)
        self.next = next
        self.random = random
```

We'll break down the code implementation once we have the overarching solution strategy clear.

### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this solution is linear, `O(N)`, because it involves iterating over the list a fixed number of times (three times in this case). The space complexity is `O(1)` because no extra data structures are used; all operations are performed in-place.

### Real-World Applications

This problem illustrates the concept of deep vs. shallow copying, which is extremely important in software development when dealing with complex data structures. Understanding this difference is crucial when you want to avoid unintended side effects from modifications to the data.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Forgetting to handle cases where the random pointer is null.
- Missing the `O(1)` space complexity requirement and using an extra map.
- Failure to restore the original list structure after weaving the original and cloned nodes together can lead to issues if the original list is needed for further operations.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem falls under the pattern of linked list manipulation with the added twist of complex pointer management due to the random pointer. Recognizing how to manipulate pointers in-place is a valuable skill for many similar linked list problems.

### Links to Similar Problems

There are many problems based on linked lists on LeetCode. Some similar problems that deal with the manipulation of complex data structures or pointer manipulation are:

- Reverse Linked List (206)
- Linked List Cycle (141)
- Merge Two Sorted Lists (21)
- Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List (430)
- Clone a Binary Tree with Random Pointer (1485)

These problems share commonalities in that they require you to manipulate pointers and the structure of data structures in some way. They serve as good practice for developing a strong understanding of data structure manipulation.

Now, let's move on to an example and actual code for the problem at hand. Let me know if you want me to provide a Python code example and detailed explanation for the ""Copy List with Random Pointer"" problem."
139,"LeetCode Problem 139 is titled ""Word Break"". The problem statement is as follows:

Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a sequence of one or more dictionary words. The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

You are required to return true if s can be segmented into a sequence of one or more dictionary words, otherwise return false.

Example 1:
Input: s = ""leetcode"", wordDict = [""leet"", ""code""]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because ""leetcode"" can be segmented as ""leet code"".

Example 2:
Input: s = ""applepenapple"", wordDict = [""apple"", ""pen""]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because ""applepenapple"" can be segmented as ""apple pen apple"".
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.

Example 3:
Input: s = ""catsandog"", wordDict = [""cats"", ""dog"", ""sand"", ""and"", ""cat""]
Output: false

The problem tests the ability to perform dynamic programming and string manipulation. To solve this problem, there are a few common approaches:

1. Dynamic Programming: This is the most common approach to tackle such problems. The idea is to use an array dp, where dp[i] represents whether the substring s[0...i) can be segmented into words in the wordDict. We initialize dp[0] = True, since an empty string is always contained in the dictionary. Then we iterate from index 1 to the length of the string, at each step, we check all possible substrings ending at the current index. If any of these substrings is a word in the dictionary and the remaining part of the string is also a word (determined by the dp array), we set dp[i] = True.

2. Backtracking with Memoization: This approach involves attempting to break the string into words and using a cache (memo) to store the results of subproblems (i.e., suffixes of the string) to avoid redundant calculations.

3. Trie (Prefix Tree): We can insert all the words in wordDict into a trie, and then use the trie to search for words in the input string s. Each node in the trie represents a character, and we can traverse through the trie according to the characters in s to check if it corresponds to a word in the dictionary.

4. Breadth-First Search (BFS): Another approach is to use BFS to explore all possible segmentations, treating each index in the string as a node in the graph and each valid word as an edge between nodes.

Now, let's elaborate on the dynamic programming approach as it is often the most efficient for this problem. Here is a detailed explanation aligned with an implementation in Python:

```python
def wordBreak(s, wordDict):
    word_set = set(wordDict)
    dp = [False] * (len(s) + 1)
    dp[0] = True
    
    for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):
        for j in range(i):
            if dp[j] and s[j:i] in word_set:
                dp[i] = True
                break

    return dp[-1]
```

Line-by-line explanation:
- Line 1: We define the function `wordBreak` that takes the string `s` and the list of words `wordDict`.
- Line 2: A set `word_set` is created from `wordDict` to allow O(1) lookup times.
- Line 3: We initialize the `dp` list with `False` values and set the first value to `True`, indicating an empty string is considered as being able to be segmented.
- Lines 5-9: This double loop is the core of the dynamic programming solution. For each substring `s[j:i]`, we check if the substring from index `j` to `i` is in the set `word_set` and if the substring `s[0:j]` can be segmented (based on `dp[j]` being True).
- Line 6: We iterate through each character of the string `s`.
- Line 7: The inner loop allows us to check all substrings that end at index `i`.
- Line 8: If `dp[j]` is True and `s[j:i]` is a word in the dictionary, then `dp[i]` is set to True, meaning the substring `s[0:i]` can be segmented.
- Line 10: We return the last element in `dp` which indicates whether the entire string can be segmented.

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n^2 * m), where 'n' is the length of the string 's' and 'm' is the length of the longest word in `wordDict`. Each substring comparison (s[j:i]) takes O(m) time, and there are O(n^2) substrings to check.
Space Complexity: O(n), where 'n' is the length of the string 's'. This space is used for the dynamic programming array `dp`.

As for real-world applications, word segmentation has implications in natural language processing (NLP), where it can be used for tokenizing text into words or phrases, which is a fundamental step for tasks such as machine translation, text-to-speech, and text mining.

Common pitfalls in this challenge include not optimizing the word lookup (thus leading to a higher time complexity), missing out on the base case where an empty string should return True, or mismanaging the indices in the loops, which could lead to off-by-one errors or unnecessary re-computation of solved subproblems.

This problem's pattern is dynamic programming, specifically dealing with substructure and overlapping subproblems. Recognizing such patterns allows for efficient problem-solving in other similar dynamic programming challenges.

Related LeetCode problems include:
- Word Break II (LeetCode 140)
- Concatenated Words (LeetCode 472)
- Palindrome Partitioning (LeetCode 131)
- Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Substrings (LeetCode 2002)

Each of these problems also requires the segmentation of strings and can benefit from dynamic programming techniques that are explored in Problem 139."
140,"LeetCode problem number 140 refers to ""Word Break II,"" a classic backtracking question that requires you to find all possible sentences you can form from a given string by concatenating words from a given list of words. Here's a detailed breakdown of the problem and an in-depth explanation of the solution.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The ""Word Break II"" problem statement is as follows:

Given a non-empty string `s` and a dictionary `wordDict` containing a list of non-empty words, add spaces in `s` to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Return all such possible sentences in any order.

Constraints:
- The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
- You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

Key Nuances:
- The order of the sentences in the result does not matter.
- If there are no possible sentences, you must return an empty list.
- The given dictionary (list of words) can contain words that the string `s` will not use at all.
- A word from the dictionary can be used multiple times as long as it fits within the constraints.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, you must approach it in a stepwise manner, breaking down the string and checking every possibility. Here are different solution strategies:

1. **Backtracking**:
   The first instinct might be to use backtracking. This involves dividing the string into substrings and checking if these substrings exist in the dictionary. If a valid substring is found, then the algorithm recursively processes the remaining part of the string following that substring.

2. **Dynamic Programming with Backtracking**:
   Backtracking can be optimized with memoization to avoid recomputation. You can use dynamic programming to keep track of whether a substring of `s` starting at a particular index can be segmented into words in `wordDict`. The results are stored in a memoization table, significantly reducing the time complexity for cases where the algorithm might repeat calculations for the same substring.

3. **Trie Data Structure**:
   Another optimization involves using a trie (prefix tree) to store the dictionary, which can result in faster lookups. However, the algorithm complexifies slightly as you need to manage the trie data structure.

The backtracking algorithm can be thought of as trying to build a tree, where each node represents a partition of the string `s` into concatenated dictionary words. The children of a node are all possible ways to break the remainder of the string after considering the current partition. Thus the valid sentences are the leaf nodes of this tree that use up all of the string `s`.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Here's how you might write the backtracking solution with memoization in Python:

```python
def wordBreak(s, wordDict):
    # Use a set for O(1) lookup.
    wordSet = set(wordDict)
    
    # Memoization to avoid re-computation.
    memo = {}

    def backtrack(start):
        # If we've reached the end of the string, there are no more words to check.
        if start == len(s):
            return [[]]

        # If we have already computed this subproblem, return the stored result.
        if start in memo:
            return memo[start]

        sentences = []

        # Consider all substrings starting from 'start'.
        for end in range(start + 1, len(s) + 1):
            word = s[start:end]
            if word in wordSet:
                # For a valid word, recursively call 'backtrack' for the remaining string.
                for subSentence in backtrack(end):
                    sentences.append([word] + subSentence)

        # Store the computed result in the memo.
        memo[start] = sentences
        return sentences

    # Call the backtrack function starting from the first character of the string.
    result = backtrack(0)
    
    # Join words to form sentences.
    return [' '.join(words) for words in result]

# Example usage:
s = ""catsanddog""
wordDict = [""cat"", ""cats"", ""and"", ""sand"", ""dog""]
print(wordBreak(s, wordDict))
```

In the above code:

- `wordBreak` is the main function that initiates the process.
- `backtrack(start)` is a helper function responsible for recursively checking all possible sentences starting from index `start`.
- The `memo` dictionary is used for memoization, storing results at each index to avoid recalculating the same substring.
- The loop within the `backtrack` function iteratively checks for all possible words that can be formed starting from index `start`.
- When a valid word is found, further recursive calls are made for the rest of the string.
- Results are accumulated in the `sentences` list, which is then stored in `memo` and returned.
- Finally, the list of word lists is joined by spaces to form sentences.

### Elaborate Examples:

For the string `s = ""catsanddog""` and `wordDict = [""cat"", ""cats"", ""and"", ""sand"", ""dog""]`, the algorithm will find:
```
""cat sand dog""
""cats and dog""
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

**Backtracking without Memoization**:
- **Time Complexity**: O(2^n) in the worst case, where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because, in theory, each character could start a new word leading to an exponential number of recursive calls.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), accounting for the call stack during recursion. If we consider the output space, it would be additional.

**Backtracking with Memoization**:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^3) in the worst case, where n is the length of the string `s`. The n^2 comes from checking every possible substring, and an extra n factor for creating substring copies.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2), to store the memoization table. Additionally, the space required for the output, which in the worst case could be as large as O(n^c) where c is the number of words in `wordDict`.

Using a trie could potentially optimize the substring lookup to O(m) where m is the length of the longest word in `wordDict`, but since this is bounded by n, it does not affect the overall time complexity.

### Real-World Applications:

This type of problem-solving method is useful in various real-world scenarios, such as:

- Natural Language Processing: segmenting a large text into known words or phrases for further analysis, such as tokenization.
- Search Engines: understanding user queries by breaking them down into known terms.
- Text-to-Speech Applications: identifying words in a string of text without spaces to properly pronounce them.
- Input Method Editors: such as those used for typing Chinese characters, where multiple characters can form different words.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

Common pitfalls in this problem include:
- Not handling duplicates in the dictionary (though the constraint excludes this).
- Not considering that a word can be used multiple times.
- Missing the optimization using memoization, resulting in a solution with much longer running time than necessary.

Tricks to optimize your solution:
- Start with a simpler backtracking approach to better understand the problem.
- Use memoization to cache results and avoid redundancy.
- Pre-processing the dictionary into a set for O(1) lookups or into a trie for potential optimization based on problem constraints.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem can be classified as a backtracking problem with an opportunity for memoization (dynamic programming). Being familiar with these patterns helps in solving similar problems. A general approach to backtracking problems is to try all possible paths, backtrack when a path leads to an invalid solution, and use memoization when subproblems overlap.

141,"LeetCode Problem #141 is titled ""Linked List Cycle"" and it is a classic problem to test one's understanding of linked list structures and two-pointer techniques. Let's proceed through each section to provide a highly detailed analysis and solution.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

The problem is formulated as follows:

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where the tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

The linked list is defined as follows:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None
```

The challenge is to write a function that takes the head of a linked list and returns `True` if there is a cycle and `False` otherwise.

Subtleties:
- Cycles can occur at any point in the linked list.
- The linked list can be of any size, and could even be empty.
- There could be a cycle that includes all nodes or just a part of the linked list.
- The list might have hundreds of thousands of nodes, indicating a need for an efficient solution.
- In-place operations are required since we're not given the ability or allowance to modify the linked list structure.

There are several ways to approach this problem:

1. **Hashing:** By traversing the list and storing each node's reference in a hash set, we can determine if we encounter a node more than once, which would indicate a cycle. However, this approach has a space complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list.

2. **Two-Pointers (Floyd's Tortoise and Hare):** This approach involves two pointers moving at different speeds – a slow pointer (the tortoise) moves one step at a time, and a fast pointer (the hare) moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle, they will eventually meet at the same node; otherwise, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list.

The Two-Pointers approach is generally preferred here because it has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Here's an implementation of the two-pointer approach:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None

def hasCycle(head):
    tortoise = hare = head
    while hare and hare.next:
        tortoise = tortoise.next
        hare = hare.next.next
        if tortoise == hare:
            return True
    return False
```

Let's break down the Python code:

- We start by initializing two pointers named `tortoise` and `hare` to the head of the linked list.
- We proceed with a loop that continues as long as `hare` and `hare.next` are not `None`. This is important as it ensures we do not encounter a `NoneType` error when accessing `hare.next.next`.
- Inside the loop, we move `tortoise` forward by one step (`tortoise = tortoise.next`) and `hare` by two steps (`hare = hare.next.next`).
- If the `tortoise` and `hare` meet at the same node (i.e., `tortoise == hare`), it means there's a cycle, so we return `True`.
- If the loop ends, it means `hare` has reached the end, and there is no cycle. Hence, we return `False`.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's take a few examples to illustrate how the function works:

- **Example 1:** A linked list where `head = [3,2,0,-4]`, and there is a cycle formed by connecting the tail node to the second node (`pos = 1`). In this case, the function would return `True`.
- **Example 2:** A linked list where `head = [1,2]`, with `pos = 0` indicating a cycle at the first node. The function would also return `True`.
- **Example 3:** A linked list where `head = [1]`, with no cycle (`pos = -1`). The function would return `False`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** Since each node is visited at most twice (once by the tortoise and once by the hare), the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list.

- **Space Complexity:** No extra space is used other than the two pointers, so the space complexity is O(1).

### Real-World Applications

Detecting cycles in a linked list is analogous to detecting cycles in many real-world applications such as resource allocation systems (to detect deadlocks), network routing (to detect routing loops), and even in biology (to detect cyclical patterns in biological networks).

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Ensuring that `hare` and `hare.next` are checked for `None` before moving `hare` two steps forward is critical to avoid `NoneType` errors.
- It's important to initialize both pointers at the head; otherwise, they'll never meet if a cycle exists.
- Understanding that if there's no cycle, the hare will eventually reach the end will ensure we don't have an infinite loop.

### Problem Pattern Identification

The Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm is a slow-fast pointer pattern useful for detecting cycles in a sequence that can be traversed in steps. Recognizing this pattern can help solve similar problems involving cycles or finding middle elements.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems

- **Problem #142 Linked List Cycle II**: This is a variation where, upon detecting a cycle, you need to find the node where the cycle begins.
- **Problem #287 Find the Duplicate Number**: A similar concept is used to detect a cycle in an array to find a duplicate number.
- **Problem #202 Happy Number**: The slow-fast pointer technique is used to detect cycles in the sequence of square digit sums to determine if a number is ""happy."""
142,"LeetCode Problem 142 is titled ""Linked List Cycle II"". This is a medium-difficulty problem that builds upon a fundamental computer science concept: detecting cycles in linked lists. Here is a detailed analysis of the problem statement followed by a comprehensive explanation of the solution strategies, a breakdown of the Python code, as well as complexity analysis and other related discussion points.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem statement for ""Linked List Cycle II"" is essentially an extension of the classic cycle detection problem. Given the head of a singly linked list, the objective is to determine if there is a cycle in the list. If there is one, the challenge is to return the node at which the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, the function should return `null`.

Subtle nuances in the problem:

1. A cycle occurs when a node's `next` pointer points back to a previous node, thus creating a loop.
2. The list may contain any number of nodes and may not contain a cycle.
3. You must solve the problem without modifying the linked list (i.e., no changing the nodes' values or `next` pointers).
4. The problem asks not just to detect the presence of a cycle, but also to return the exact node where the cycle begins, which is a more advanced requirement compared to simply detecting a cycle.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

Two popular approaches to solve this problem are:

**1. Hash Table Approach:**
   - Traverse the linked list and keep track of each visited node using a set or hash table.
   - If you encounter a node that has already been visited, that node is the start of the cycle.
   - If you reach the end of the list (`next` pointer is `null`), then there is no cycle.

The hash table approach is simple and easy to implement but has a space complexity proportional to the number of nodes in the list, which can be considerable.

**2. Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm (Two-pointer Approach):**
   - Use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`. The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time, while the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time.
   - If there is a cycle, the `fast` pointer will eventually meet the `slow` pointer inside the cycle.
   - Once a cycle is detected, reset one of the pointers to the head of the list and move both pointers at one step at a time. The node where they meet is the start of the cycle.

Floyd's algorithm is preferred because it requires only constant space, making it more efficient in terms of memory usage.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's implement Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None

def detectCycle(head):
    slow, fast = head, head
   
    # First phase: Find the intersection point if there is a cycle
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            # There is a cycle, now move to find the entry point
            break
    else:
        # No cycle
        return None

    # Second phase: Find the entry point of the cycle
    slow = head
    while slow != fast:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next
    
    return slow
```

First, we define a class `ListNode`, which represents a node in the linked list with a value `val` and a pointer to the next node `next`.

The `detectCycle` function starts with two pointers, both initially pointing to the head of the list. We then enter a loop where the `slow` pointer moves one step and the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time. If the `fast` pointer reaches the end (either `fast` or `fast.next` is `null`), the loop exits, indicating there is no cycle, and the function returns `None`.

If a cycle exists, the `slow` and `fast` pointers will meet inside the cycle. It's a mathematical certainty that if a cycle exists, due to the different speeds at which the pointers move, they will eventually be at the same node.

After detection, we reset the `slow` pointer to the head and move both `slow` and `fast` pointers one step at a time. The node where they meet will be the entry point to the cycle. This works because the distance from the head of the list to the entry point of the cycle is the same as the distance from the intersection point inside the cycle to the entry point when both points are traversed one step at a time.

### Elaborate Examples:

Suppose we have the following linked list with a cycle:

```
3 -> 2 -> 0 -> -4
     ^          |
     |__________|
```

In this list, the cycle begins at the node with value 2. If we were to pass the head of this list to our `detectCycle` function, here's what would happen:

1. The `slow` and `fast` pointers start at node with value 3.
2. They proceed to node 2, `slow` moves to node 0, while `fast` moves to node -4.
3. Then `slow` goes to node -4, and `fast` (moves two steps) again meets `slow` at node 2.
4. Since `slow` and `fast` met, we move `slow` back to the head of the list (node with value 3).
5. Both `slow` and `fast` now move one step at a time until they meet at node 2, which is the cycle's starting node.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

**Time Complexity:**
- The time complexity of Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because each pointer traverses each node at most once.

**Space Complexity:**
- The space complexity of Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm is O(1), since it uses only two pointers, regardless of the size of the linked list.

### Real-World Applications:

Cycle detection in linked lists is important in computer science, as it can represent resource allocation problems or be used in garbage collection algorithms where cyclical references must be detected. It's also applicable in detecting infinite loops in certain types of applications.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Remember to check if the list is empty or if there's only one node, which trivially can't form a cycle.
- Be careful when moving the `fast` pointer: always check `fast` and `fast.next` for `None` to prevent `NoneType` errors.
- Understanding the mathematical proof of Floyd's Algorithm might be tricky. Trust the algorithm: if `slow` and `fast` meet, there is a cycle.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

The ""Linked List Cycle II"" problem is a two-pointer problem, where pointers traverse a data structure at different speeds to detect cycles or find a specific condition.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:

Other LeetCode problems that involve cycle detection or two-pointer techniques include:

- ""Linked List Cycle"" (LeetCode 141): a simpler version where you only need to detect the presence of a cycle, not its starting node.
- ""Find the Duplicate Number"" (LeetCode 287): employs a similar two-pointer technique to detect a cycle in the context of an array.
- ""Happy Number"" (LeetCode 202): uses cycle detection to identify when the iteration falls into a loop.

The skills learned in this problem, especially the understanding of Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm, can be directly applied to solving these and other similar problems."
143,"LeetCode Problem #143 is called ""Reorder List"". It's a medium difficulty problem that focuses on manipulating a singly linked list. Here is an extensive breakdown of the problem, followed by various strategies for solving it, with Python code explanations.

### Problem Breakdown

Given a singly linked list `L: L0→L1→…→Ln-1→Ln`, reorder it to: `L0→Ln→L1→Ln-1→L2→Ln-2→…`

You must do this in-place without altering the nodes' values.

For example, if given a linked list `1→2→3→4`, reorder it to `1→4→2→3`.

#### Subtle Nuances

- The problem specifies that the reordering must be done in-place, which means you shouldn't allocate new nodes.
- The reordering is a specific pattern that interleaves the nodes from the beginning and end of the list.
- Care must be taken to handle the case when there's an odd number of nodes since the middle node will not be paired.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

A straightforward brute-force approach might involve using additional data structures like an array to store node references, and then rebuild the list in the new order. However, this isn't in-place and won't satisfy the problem's constraints.

The in-place solution involves a few steps:

1. **Find the middle of the list:** Use the fast and slow pointer technique to find the middle node. The slow pointer advances one step at a time while the fast pointer advances two steps. When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle.

2. **Reverse the second half of the list:** Once the middle is found, reverse the list starting from the middle to the end.

3. **Merge the two halves:** Interleave nodes from the first and second halves. Carefully update the next pointers to reorder the list according to the given pattern.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Here's Python code that follows the steps outlined above:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def reorderList(head):
    if not head or not head.next:
        return
    
    # Step 1: Find the middle of the list
    slow, fast = head, head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    
    # Step 2: Reverse the second half of the list
    prev, cur = None, slow
    while cur:
        next_temp = cur.next
        cur.next = prev
        prev = cur
        cur = next_temp
    
    # Step 3: Merge the two halves
    first, second = head, prev
    while second.next:
        first.next, first = second, first.next
        second.next, second = first, second.next

# Usage example
# Assuming the list is built and head is a reference to the head of the list
reorderList(head)
```

Let's break down this code:

- We define a `ListNode` class. This is a standard definition for a node in a singly linked list, with a `val` holding the node's value and `next` pointing to the next node in the list.
- The `reorderList` function starts by handling base cases where the list is empty or has only one element. In these cases, no reordering is necessary.
- In **Step 1**, we initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`. We advance them through the list to find the middle node.
- In **Step 2**, we reverse the second half of the list using the standard linked list reversal technique. We use variables `prev` and `cur` to keep track of the nodes during the reversal process.
- In **Step 3**, we take the first and second parts of the list (`first` points to the head of the list and `second` points to the head of the reversed second half) and start interleaving them, carefully updating the `next` pointers.

### Elaborate Examples

Let's consider the list `1→2→3→4→5`, and apply the code step by step:

1. After finding the middle of the list, the list is still `1→2→3→4→5`, and `slow` is pointing to `3`.
   
2. The second half of the list is reversed, resulting in `1→2→3` and `5→4`.

3. The list is then merged to create `1→5→2→4→3`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. Finding the middle takes O(N/2), reversing the second half takes O(N/2), and merging takes O(N/2), adding up to O(N).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as no extra space is used other than a few pointers.

### Real-World Applications

Reordering a linked list might not have a direct real-world counterpart, but the techniques used—finding the middle of a linked list, reversing a linked list, and merging lists—are fundamental operations applicable in many real-world scenarios. For example, these operations are useful in pagination systems, playlist shuffling, or in any system where in-place list manipulation is needed to optimize memory usage.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks

- Forgetting to handle cases where there's an odd number of elements in the list.
- Not properly handling the last node of the first half or the new tail in the second half, which can lead to a cycle in the list or loss of part of the list.

### Problem Pattern Identification

144,"LeetCode Problem 144 is titled ""Binary Tree Preorder Traversal,"" and it focuses on a classic tree traversal problem. Preorder traversal is a method of visiting the nodes of a binary tree in a specific order: first the root node, then recursively the left subtree, and finally the right subtree. This is often summarized by the mnemonic ""root-left-right.""

Here's the essential problem statement:

Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example, given a binary tree:

```
    1
     \
      2
     /
    3
```

The preorder traversal would be `[1, 2, 3]`.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown

- Input:
  The problem provides a binary tree, which is typically represented in the problem description as the root node of the binary tree data structure. The tree is comprised of nodes, where each node contains a value and two pointers, one to its left child and the other to its right child.
  
- Output:
  The output should be an array or list of integers that represent the values of the nodes visited in preorder traversal order.
  
- Constraints:
  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`, and the values of the nodes are integers between `-100` and `100`.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

There are generally two methods to approach this problem:

#### Recursive Approach

The recursive approach is the most straightforward method for tree traversal problems like this one. It energetically reflects the definition of preorder traversal:

1. Visit the root node and add its value to the output list.
2. Recursively perform a preorder traversal on the left subtree.
3. Recursively perform a preorder traversal on the right subtree.

The base case for the recursive function is when the current node is null, which means that the edge of the tree has been reached, and there's nothing left to visit.

#### Iterative Approach

Alternatively, the problem can be solved iteratively using a stack. The iterative approach is somewhat more complex but is valuable to know as it can be more space-efficient, particularly in highly unbalanced trees, and is more easily translated into an iterative generator pattern:

1. Initialize an empty stack and push the root node onto it.
2. While the stack is not empty, pop the top node off the stack and add its value to the output list.
3. If the popped node has a right child, push it onto the stack.
4. If the popped node has a left child, push it onto the stack.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the stack is empty.

Both methods ultimately achieve the same result, but they differ in execution and can have different space complexities in certain scenarios.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's focus on implementing both the recursive and iterative approaches in Python.

#### Recursive Approach

```python
def preorderTraversal(self, root):
    def dfs(node):
        if not node:
            return []
        return [node.val] + dfs(node.left) + dfs(node.right)
    
    return dfs(root)
```

In this code snippet, `dfs` is a nested helper function that performs depth-first search on the nodes. It checks if the current node is `None` and if so, returns an empty list (this is the base case). Otherwise, it creates a list with the current node's value and appends the results of recursively calling `dfs` on the left and right children.

#### Iterative Approach

```python
def preorderTraversal(self, root):
    if root is None:
        return []
    
    stack, output = [root], []
    
    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        output.append(node.val)
        if node.right:
            stack.append(node.right)
        if node.left:
            stack.append(node.left)
    
    return output
```

For the iterative approach, we start by checking if the root is `None`. If it is, we return an empty list. We then initialize a stack with the root node and an empty list called `output` as the preorder traversal result. We pop nodes from the stack, add their values to the output, and push their children onto the stack in reverse order of how we want to visit them (right child first since it's a stack and we want to visit the left child first).

### Elaborate Examples

Let's go through a worked-out example using the iterative approach.

Given a binary tree:

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 /     \
4       5
```

The initial `stack` is `[1]`, and `output` is `[]`. Here's how it works:

1. Pop `1`, add to output: `output = [1]`, push `3`, then `2` onto the stack: `stack = [2, 3]`.
2. Pop `2`, add to output: `output = [1, 2]`, push `4` onto the stack: `stack = [4, 3]`.
3. Pop `4`, add to output: `output = [1, 2, 4]`, no children to push: `stack = [3]`.
4. Pop `3`, add to output: `output = [1, 2, 4, 3]`, push `5` onto the stack: `stack = [5]`.
5. Pop `5`, add to output: `output = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]`, no children to push: `stack = []`.
6. Stack is empty, pre-order traversal is complete: `output = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]`.

Thus, the preorder traversal is `[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

For both the recursive and iterative approaches, we visit each node exactly once, making the time complexity `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree.

In the recursive approach, the space complexity is `O(N)` in the worst case due to the recursion stack (for a completely unbalanced tree), but it's `O(logN)` on average, for a balanced tree due to the height of the recursion tree.

In the iterative approach, the space complexity is `O(N)` in the worst case if the tree is completely unbalanced (only right children or only left children), but space used by the stack is proportional to the depth of the tree, which is `O(logN)` on average for a balanced tree.

### Real-World Applications

Preorder traversal algorithms can be found in various real-world applications such as:

- Creation of expression trees where an infix expression is converted into a corresponding prefix form, evaluated later through preorder traversal.
- Serialization of a binary tree structure so that it can be reconstructed later.
- Implementing prefix notation in calculators and compilers, which is directly related to preorder traversal of an expression tree.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

When implementing the iterative version of preorder traversal, a common pitfall is to push the left child onto the stack before the right child. Since the stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, pushing the left child last would mean it will be popped off the stack and processed before the right child, which violates the preorder traversal order.

To effectively leverage recursion in Python, ensure that you're aware of Python's recursion limit, which can be altered using `sys.setrecursionlimit(limit)` if needed, though it's atypical for this specific problem.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem falls into the category of Binary Tree Traversal problems. Recognizing the preorder traversal pattern helps to solve similar problems like creating expression trees or performing other types of binary tree walks (e.g., inorder, postorder).

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems

- Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal (LeetCode #103)

Studying these problems will help reinforce the concepts of tree traversal and broaden understanding of different tree operations."
145,"The problem number 145 on LeetCode corresponds to ""Binary Tree Postorder Traversal"". This is a classic algorithmic challenge that involves traversing a binary tree. Here's an extensive problem breakdown, solution rationale, and other detailed insights for this problem.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

In binary tree postorder traversal, the goal is to visit all the nodes in a binary tree in a specific order: first, you visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the node itself. This order is commonly remembered by the acronym LRV (Left-Right-Visit), where ""Visit"" means reading or printing the value of the node.

The problem can be summarized as follows:

- You are given the root of a binary tree.
- You need to return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

This traversal method is essential in applications where operations on the parent node must happen after operations on the children, for example, when performing certain calculations, memory cleanup, or syntax tree analysis in compilers.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

There are several strategies to solve the postorder traversal problem:

1. **Recursive Approach**:
    - The recursive solution is a direct translation of the postorder traversal definition.
    - The recursion function calls itself to traverse the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally appends the current node's value to the result list.
    - This approach tends to be clean and concise.

2. **Iterative Approach**:
    - An iterative solution can be implemented using a stack to simulate the call stack that would be used in a recursive approach.
    - Traversal is done by looping until all nodes are visited while utilizing a stack to keep track of the nodes.
    - Care must be taken to visit nodes in the postorder sequence.
    - Iterative solutions are sometimes preferred due to stack overflow concerns with very deep trees when using recursion.

3. **Morris Traversal**:
    - This method allows for traversal without extra space (aside from the output list) and without modifying the tree structure.
    - It's a complex method that creates temporary links in the tree (threads) to emulate the traversal process.
    - Morris traversal is not commonly used for postorder traversal.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation (Recursive Approach):

Here's a Python function implementing the recursive approach:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def postorderTraversal(root):
    def recurse(node):
        if not node:
            return []
        return recurse(node.left) + recurse(node.right) + [node.val]
    
    return recurse(root)
```

This function is composed of two parts:
- A `TreeNode` class representing nodes in a binary tree.
- The `postorderTraversal` function which takes the root of the tree and returns a list of its values in postorder sequence.

The `recurse` is an inner function that performs the actual traversal. If the node it's called with is `None`, it returns an empty list. Then it calls itself on the left and right child if they exist and finally appends the current node's value.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's consider a simple binary tree:

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5
```

A postorder traversal would visit the nodes in the following order: 4, 5, 2, 3, 1.

Running `postorderTraversal(root)` where `root` is the root of the above tree, the output of the function would be:

```python
[4, 5, 2, 3, 1]
```

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

The recursive solution for postorder traversal has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because it visits each node exactly once.

The space complexity is also O(n), but this is a little more nuanced. In the worst case, the tree is completely unbalanced (e.g., a linked list), and the call stack used by the recursion will have a depth equal to the number of nodes. However, in a balanced tree, the average stack depth would be O(log n).

### Real-World Applications:

Postorder traversal finds its applications in scenarios where children nodes must be processed before their parent node. Some of those scenarios are:
- Expression tree evaluation, where you need to evaluate the operands before applying the operator.
- Filesystem cleanup processes, where you delete child directories before parent directories.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

A common pitfall with recursion-based tree traversal is not handling the base case correctly (when a node is `None`).

A trick with the iterative approach is using two stacks to simulate the postorder traversal, or you can use a single stack with a more complex state management.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem falls into the ""Tree Traversal"" category. Recognizing this pattern can help solve problems that involve visiting nodes of a tree in a particular order or to convert one type of depth-first traversal to another.

146,"LeetCode problem number 146 refers to the ""LRU Cache"" problem. Let's break down this problem in detail:

## Extensive Problem Breakdown:
The LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache is a data structure that provides fast access to its entries and maintains the order of usage to quickly identify and remove the least recently used items when the capacity is exceeded. The LRU Cache problem has the following characteristics:

- The cache should support the `get` and `put` operations.
- `get(key)` should return the value of the key if the key exists in the cache, else return -1.
- `put(key, value)` should update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, it should add the key-value pair to the cache. If the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before adding the new item.
- The LRU Cache has a fixed size, and when inserting an element that would exceed this size, the least recently used element is evicted from the cache.
- All operations must be performed in O(1) time complexity.

The nuances of this problem involve ensuring that the `get` and `put` operations are both time-efficient and that the LRU eviction happens correctly.

## In-Depth Solution Rationale:
To achieve the O(1) time complexity for both get and put operations, we need to use a data structure that supports fast access, insertion, and deletion. The ideal candidate is a combination of a hash table and a doubly linked list.

- **Hash Table**: Allows us to quickly look up the existence of an item, and get/set a value by key in O(1) time.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Allows us to quickly add/remove items from the ends of the list (necessary to maintain LRU order) in O(1) time.

Here's the strategy for using these structures:

1. Store each key paired with a reference to its corresponding node in the list (which contains the value) in a hash table.
2. Maintain a doubly linked list of nodes, where each node contains a key-value pair. The front of the list represents the most recently used items, and the back represents the least recently used items.
3. Whenever `get` is called, move the accessed item to the front of the list to mark it as most recently used.
4. Whenever `put` is called, insert the new item at the front of the list. If the key already exists, update the value and move the item to the front. If the capacity is exceeded, remove the item at the back of the list, and also remove its key from the hash table.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, key=None, value=None):
        self.key = key
        self.value = value
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None

class LRUCache:

    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.cache = {}  # Maps key to node
        self.head = ListNode()  # Dummy head
        self.tail = ListNode()  # Dummy tail
        self.head.next = self.tail  # Initialize the linked list
        self.tail.prev = self.head

    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        if key in self.cache:
            node = self.cache[key]
            self._remove(node)
            self._add(node)
            return node.value
        return -1

    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
        if key in self.cache:
            self._remove(self.cache[key])
        node = ListNode(key, value)
        self.cache[key] = node
        self._add(node)
        if len(self.cache) > self.capacity:
            lru_node = self.tail.prev
            self._remove(lru_node)
            del self.cache[lru_node.key]

    def _add(self, node):
        head_next = self.head.next
        self.head.next = node
        node.prev = self.head
        node.next = head_next
        head_next.prev = node

    def _remove(self, node):
        node.prev.next = node.next
        node.next.prev = node.prev

# Usage:
# cache = LRUCache(2)
# cache.put(1, 1)
# cache.put(2, 2)
# print(cache.get(1))       # returns 1
# cache.put(3, 3)           # evicts key 2
# print(cache.get(2))       # returns -1 (not found)
# cache.put(4, 4)           # evicts key 1
# print(cache.get(1))       # returns -1 (not found)
# print(cache.get(3))       # returns 3
# print(cache.get(4))       # returns 4
```

The code snippet above defines a class `ListNode` to represent a node in the doubly linked list, and a class `LRUCache` that implements the LRU Cache as described.

- The `_add` private method adds a node to the front of the doubly linked list.
- The `_remove` private method removes a node from its current position in the doubly linked list.
- The `get` method will check if the key is in the cache, and if it is, it moves the node to the front to mark it as recently used before returning the value.
- The `put` method adds a new node to the front of the list or updates the value of an existing node and also ensures the capacity is not exceeded by removing the LRU item.

## Elaborate Examples:
Assuming our LRUCache is instantiated with a capacity of 2:

1. `cache.put(1, 1)` – Adds key 1 with value 1. List is now [1].
2. `cache.put(2, 2)` – Adds key 2 with value 2. List is now [2, 1].
3. `cache.get(1)` – Returns 1 and moves key 1 to the front. List is now [1, 2].
4. `cache.put(3, 3)` – Adds key 3 with value 3 and removes key 2 (LRU). List is now [3, 1].
5. `cache.get(2)` – Returns -1 because key 2 has been evicted.
6. `cache.put(4, 4)` – Adds key 4 with value 4 and removes key 1 (LRU). List is now [4, 3].
7. `cache.get(1)` – Returns -1 because key 1 has been evicted.
8. `cache.get(3)` – Returns 3.
9. `cache.get(4)` – Returns 4.

## Thorough Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity of both `get` and `put` operations is O(1). This is because accessing the hash table, adding an item to the front of the list, and removing an item from the list (either designated by the hash table or the last one) are all constant-time operations.

The space complexity is O(capacity), as it stores up to capacity key-value pairs in both the hash table and the doubly linked list.

## Real-World Applications:
A real-world application of an LRU cache could be seen in a web browser caching web pages. The browser would cache a fixed number of pages, and when this number is exceeded, the least recently viewed page would be removed from the cache to make room for a new one. Other applications include caching in operating systems, databases, and web servers.

## Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
- One of the common pitfalls is not properly updating the doubly linked list when getting/putting keys, which might lead to incorrect LRU order or lost references.
- A tip is to use dummy head and tail nodes, as they simplify the edge case handling when adding or removing nodes from the list.

## Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem is a classic example of the ""Design"" type, where one needs to design a data structure that satisfies specific constraints. It also involves linked lists manipulation and hash table usage, patterns that appear in numerous other data structure problems.

147,"LeetCode problem number 147 corresponds to ""Insertion Sort List."" This problem asks you to sort a singly linked list using insertion sort.

Here is the problem statement for your reference:

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, sort the list using insertion sort, and return the sorted list's head.

**The Insertion Sort algorithm** is described as follows:
- Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a sorted output list.
- At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there.
- It repeats until no input elements remain.

The following functions are provided for the problem's purposes:

- Definition for singly-linked list:
  ```python
  class ListNode:
      def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
          self.val = val
          self.next = next
  ```

Here is a detailed analysis of the solution strategy:

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

The solution for this problem involves simulating the insertion sort algorithm for a singly linked list. In standard insertion sort on arrays, elements from the unsorted section of the array are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted section.

With a linked list, a similar strategy is followed, but with some key differences due to the linked list's non-contiguous memory allocation and single-directional nature. Here is a broad overview of the steps:

1. **Initialization**: Start with an initially empty ""sorted"" list.
2. **Iteration**: Go through each node in the input list, by iterating over it from head to tail.
3. **Finding Insertion Point**: For the current node, we'll need to find the correct place to insert it within the ""sorted"" list. 
   - This involves iterating over the ""sorted"" list and comparing values until we find the first node that has a larger value than the current node.
4. **Insertion**: Insert the current node in the ""sorted"" list right before the node found in step 3.
5. **Repetition**: Repeat steps 2-4 until the original list is empty.

The actual implementation has to handle pointers correctly to ensure the list remains intact. Especially critical are the cases where the insertion occurs at the beginning of the ""sorted"" list or when two nodes need to be swapped.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

In Python implementation, we will need a dummy node to act as the pre-head of the sorted segment, making insertion at the head of the list easier, and variables to keep track of the current node and its previous node in the iteration.

```python
class Solution:
    def insertionSortList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # Dummy node acts as the pre-head of the sorted list
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        # Current node is initially the head of the input list
        current = head
        
        while current:
            # At each iteration, prev_node is the last node of sorted list where current should be inserted after
            prev_node = dummy
            # Find the insertion point
            while prev_node.next and prev_node.next.val < current.val:
                prev_node = prev_node.next
            
            # This will be the next node to process
            next_to_process = current.next
            
            # Insert current node after prev_node and before prev_node.next
            current.next = prev_node.next
            prev_node.next = current
            
            # Move to the next node in the input list
            current = next_to_process
        
        return dummy.next
```

In this code, the while loop goes through each node of the original list. We compare `current.val` with values of the sorted list looking for the insertion point. Once we find the position (`prev_node.next`), we insert `current` between `prev_node` and `prev_node.next`, and we ensure `current` gets updated to the next node in the unsorted list.

The `dummy` node is a useful trick that simplifies edge cases for insertion at the start of the sorted list since it will always exist. Finally, we return `dummy.next`, which points to the head of the sorted list.

### Elaborate Examples

To explore how the solution would work with an actual linked list, let's consider the following example:

Input: `4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3`

1. Initially 'dummy' points to a node with `val=0`, and 'current' points to `4`.
2. For `4`, since the sorted list is empty, `prev_node` remains `dummy` and `4` gets inserted as the first element.
3. Now 'current' moves to `2`, `prev_node` traverses from `dummy` and stops before `4` since `2 < 4`, and `2` gets inserted before `4`.
4. Continue with `1` and `3` using similar logic.

Eventually, the final sorted list is `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`, and we return this as the result of `dummy.next`.

### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of insertion sort is O(n^2) in the average and worst case, where `n` is the number of elements in the list, because for each node, we may need to traverse the entire sorted portion of the list to find the insertion point.

The space complexity is O(1), since we sort the list in place and only a constant number of pointers are used, regardless of the size of the input list.

### Real-World Applications

Insertion sort is less frequently used for general sorting tasks because more efficient algorithms are available for large inputs (like quicksort, mergesort, etc.). However, it has several applications where the input list is almost sorted, or when dealing with streaming data where the input arrives in real-time and we need to maintain a sorted structure at all times.

### Potential Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Relinking Nodes**: Failing to correctly reassign the pointers could corrupt the linked list. Always monitor the next pointers carefully.
- **Infinite Loops**: If the insertion point isn't handled correctly, it could lead to infinite loops. Ensure that the iterations are progressing the pointers.
- **Dummy Node Ignored**: Not starting with a dummy node can make handling insertions at the start of the sorted list more complex and error-prone.

### Problem Pattern Identification

This problem is a variation of the sorting problem, specifically tailored to linked lists. It teaches how to adapt typical array-based sorting algorithms to the linked list data structure.

148,"LeetCode problem 148 is titled ""Sort List,"" which falls into the category of linked list operations and specifically deals with the sorting algorithms in the context of a singly linked list.

## Problem Statement:

Given the head of a linked list, return the list after sorting it in ascending order.

## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 5 * 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

## Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The task requires sorting a singly linked list, which is a data structure where each element (commonly called a 'node') contains some value and a reference to the next node in the sequence. In contrast with arrays, linked lists have no indices, which means we cannot do random access, and therefore, many of the typical sorting algorithms like QuickSort, which rely on index-based operations, are not practical here.

The challenge lies in efficiently sorting the list without the ability to quickly access elements by index. Remember that the only way to traverse a singly linked list is in one direction, from the head to the end, one node at a time. Consequently, sorting algorithms that are based on comparisons and can work with sequential access, such as Merge Sort, are generally preferred for this task.

The problem constraints imply that the solution must be efficient enough to handle lists with a large number of nodes and the values within the nodes can vary widely.

## In-Depth Solution Rationale:

Given the nature of linked lists, one efficient method for sorting the list is the Merge Sort algorithm. Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that breaks down a list into several sub-lists until each sub-list consists of a single element, then merges those sub-lists to produce sorted sub-lists, and repeatedly merges sub-lists to produce new sorted sub-lists until there is only one sub-list remaining; this will be the sorted list.

Merge Sort is particularly suitable for linked lists for the following reasons:
- It does not require random access to elements.
- It has a time complexity of O(n log n) which is the best we can get for a sorting algorithm on average and worst-case scenarios.
- It can be implemented to use O(1) extra space for linked lists, which meets the space complexity constraint.

To apply Merge Sort to a linked list, we can follow these steps:
1. Use the **fast and slow pointer technique** to find the middle of the linked list.
2. Once the middle node is found, split the linked list into two halves.
3. Recursively apply Merge Sort to both halves of the list.
4. Merge the two halves together to form a sorted list.

The merge step operates by comparing the head nodes of the two lists and selecting the node with the smaller value to become the next node of the merged list, continuing this process until all nodes have been included in the merged list.

## Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Let's break down the Python code using Merge Sort for sorting the linked list into individual operations and explain their purposes:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def sortList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        
        # Step 1: Find the middle of the list
        slow, fast = head, head.next
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        
        # Step 2: Split the list into two halves
        mid, slow.next = slow.next, None
        
        # Step 3: Recursively sort both halves
        left = self.sortList(head)
        right = self.sortList(mid)
        
        # Step 4: Merge the sorted halves
        return self.merge(left, right)

    def merge(self, left: Optional[ListNode], right: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode()
        tail = dummy
        while left and right:
            if left.val < right.val:
                tail.next, left = left, left.next
            else:
                tail.next, right = right, right.next
            tail = tail.next
        
        # Append the remaining nodes of either list
        tail.next = left or right
        return dummy.next
```

1. `class ListNode` is a standard definition for list nodes provided by LeetCode.
2. `class Solution` contains the method `sortList` which is called to sort the linked list.
3. `if not head or not head.next:` is a base case for the recursive function; if either the list is empty or contains only a single node, it is already sorted, and we return it as is.
4. To find the middle of the list, slow and fast pointer technique is used: `slow` moves one step at a time and `fast` moves two steps. When `fast` reaches the end, `slow` would be at the middle.
5. The line `mid, slow.next = slow.next, None` splits the list into two halves. The first half starts from `head` and ends at `slow`. The second half starts from `mid` which is the node after `slow`. Cutting the list into two halves is achieved by setting `slow.next` to `None`.
6. The recursion happens with `left = self.sortList(head)` and `right = self.sortList(mid)`, sorting both halves separately.
7. The `merge` function takes two sorted sub-lists (`left` and `right`) and merges them, creating one sorted list.
8. The merging process goes through both lists and adds the smaller node to the result list by adjusting the `next` pointers until all nodes from both sub-lists are merged.
9. Finally, if one of the sublists is exhausted before the other, the remaining elements are attached to the end of the merged list.

## Elaborate Examples:

To understand the merge operation better, let's consider two sub-lists that need to be merged:

Sub-list 1: 1 -> 3 -> 5
Sub-list 2: 2 -> 4 -> 6

Merged list: 
- Compare 1 with 2, since 1 is smaller, it goes first. Now the sub-lists look like:
  Sub-list 1: 3 -> 5
  Sub-list 2: 2 -> 4 -> 6
- Compare 3 with 2, since 2 is smaller, we choose it. Now:
  Sub-list 1: 3 -> 5
  Sub-list 2: 4 -> 6
- And so on until:

Final Merged list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6

## Thorough Complexity Analysis:

For the time complexity, each merge operation takes O(n) time, where n is the total number of nodes in the lists being merged. Since Merge Sort splits the list in half each time and each level of split requires a total of O(n) work during the merge, the total time complexity is O(n log n).

The space complexity of this algorithm can be O(1) because we are just rearranging point

ers and not allocating any additional data structures. However, the recursive approach uses O(log n) space on the runtime stack.

## Real-World Applications:

Sorting algorithms, including those adapted for linked lists, are fundamental in computing and are applied in various contexts:
- Organizing data for efficient search or retrieval (e.g., in file management systems).
- Preparing for algorithms that require sorted data (e.g., binary search or closest pair problems).
- Serving as a subroutine in more complex algorithms or systems.

## Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Forgetting the base case in the recursive function can lead to stack overflow.
- Incorrectly handling the `next` pointers can result in lost nodes or even cycles in the linked list.
- Not setting `slow.next` to `None` would not properly split the list into two halves.
- Forgetting to handle the case when one list is exhausted before the other in the `merge` function.

Understanding the Merge Sort algorithm and how to implement it on a linked list helps avoid these pitfalls. Additionally, being careful with pointer manipulation is critical.

## Problem Pattern Identification:

The pattern here is using the divide-and-conquer technique with pointers manipulation in linked list data structures. This pattern is relevant for problems where the solution involves breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems that are easier to solve.

149,"LeetCode Problem #149 is ""Max Points on a Line."" This is a classic problem from computational geometry that requires finding the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line within a given set of points.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the problem:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem provides a list of `point` coordinates, each represented by a pair of integers `[x, y]`. The objective is to determine the maximum number of points that align in a straight line.

Subtle nuances of the problem include:
- Dealing with vertical lines, which have undefined slope.
- Handling overlapping points (i.e., points with the same coordinates), which should be counted multiple times if they exist.
- Considering precision issues, since the calculation of the slope might result in floating-point numbers.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

To solve this problem, one has to understand that two points always form a line. The task is essentially to figure out the line with the most points from the given list. A common approach is to consider each point and calculate the slopes of lines that pass through that point and every other point. Points that share the same slope with respect to the current point are on the same line.

There are several challenges to tackle:
- Calculating the slope and handling division by zero or close to zero values.
- Distinguishing between slightly different slopes due to floating-point precision.
- Avoiding redundant calculations (for instance, if a line through two points has been considered, it should not be counted again).

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

A typical Python solution would iterate through each point, use a hash table to count the occurrences of each slope, and determine the maximum count recorded across all iterations. Here's how such a solution might look line-by-line:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from math import gcd

def maxPoints(points):
    def max_points_from(i):
        lines = defaultdict(int)
        local_max, overlap, vertical = 0, 0, 0
        
        for j in range(i + 1, len(points)):
            x1, y1 = points[i]
            x2, y2 = points[j]
            if x1 == x2 and y1 == y2:  # Count overlapping points
                overlap += 1
            elif x1 == x2:  # Handling vertical lines
                vertical += 1
            else:  # Regular case, calculate the slope and update the count
                dy = y2 - y1
                dx = x2 - x1
                g = gcd(dx, dy)
                slope = (dx // g, dy // g)  # Using a tuple to avoid floating-point precision issues
                lines[slope] += 1
                local_max = max(local_max, lines[slope])
        
        return max(local_max, vertical) + overlap + 1

    max_points = 0
    for i in range(len(points)):
        max_points_from_i = max_points_from(i)
        max_points = max(max_points, max_points_from_i)

    return max_points

# Example points array
points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
print(maxPoints(points))
```

This code uses a helper function `max_points_from` to calculate lines through the `i`-th point. It does so by counting duplicates, handling vertical lines specially, and normalizing the slope (using GCD to reduce to lowest terms) to avoid precision errors. The main function iterates through each point and keeps track of the maximum number of points on a line formed with that point.

### Elaborate Examples:

Here, you can add multiple test cases including vertical lines, overlapping points, and all unique points to demonstrate the effectiveness of the given code.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of the solution is `O(N^2)` since for each of the `N` points we are looking at all other points in a nested loop. Space complexity is `O(N)` due to the additional hash table used to store slopes for each starting point.

### Real-World Applications:

This problem can be applied to various fields such as geographical mapping, pattern recognition, and computer vision, where one might need to determine lines of best fit or alignment among data points.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

A potential pitfall is the handling of identical points and vertical lines. Additionally, using divisions to find slopes can lead to precision issues, so it is essential to use a stable representation, such as a reduced fraction.

150,"LeetCode Problem #150 is the ""Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation"" problem. Let's dissect it in depth.

### Problem Statement

The problem requires us to evaluate expressions in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), also known as postfix notation. In RPN, operators follow their operands, which allows the expression to be evaluated without the need for parentheses to denote operation precedence.

An RPN expression is provided as an array of strings. Each element in the array is either an integer or one of the four operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. It is guaranteed that the given RPN expression is always valid, which means the expression would always evaluate to a result, and there would not be any division by zero operations.

Here is an example of a simple RPN expression and its evaluation:

```
[""2"", ""1"", ""+"", ""3"", ""*""] -> ((2 + 1) * 3) -> 9
```

The goal is to evaluate the given RPN expression and return the evaluation result.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale

To solve this problem, we can use a stack, which is quite suitable for processing RPN expressions. Here's the strategy:

1. **Initialization**: Create an empty stack.
2. **Processing**: Iterate over each token (string) in the array:
   - If the token is a number, push it onto the stack.
   - If the token is an operator, pop the top two elements from the stack, apply the operator, and push the result back onto the stack.
3. **Finalization**: After processing all tokens, the stack will contain one element, which is the result of the expression.

Using a stack helps manage the intermediate results as we proceed through the tokens, and the order of operations naturally flows from the postfix format of the expression.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation

Let's translate the above strategy into Python code:

```python
def evalRPN(tokens):
    stack = []
    for token in tokens:
        if token not in ""+-*/"":
            stack.append(int(token))
        else:
            # At this point, we know the token is an operator.
            # We pop the last two numbers to apply the operation.
            b = stack.pop()  # Operand 2
            a = stack.pop()  # Operand 1
            
            # Perform the operation
            if token == '+':
                stack.append(a + b)
            elif token == '-':
                stack.append(a - b)
            elif token == '*':
                stack.append(a * b)
            elif token == '/':
                # Division in RPN should truncate towards zero.
                stack.append(int(a / b))  # Truncate division in Python 3
    # The result is the last item on the stack.
    return stack.pop()
```

In the code, we iterate over each token. If it's an operand, we convert it to an integer (since the input is in string format) and push it onto the stack. If it's an operator, we pop the last two operands from the stack. It's important to note the order of operands when popped: the last popped element is used as the second operand (`b`) and the penultimate popped element as the first operand (`a`) because of the stack's LIFO (last in, first out) nature. We then carry out the operation and push the result back onto the stack.

### Elaborate Examples

Consider the expression: 

```
[""4"", ""13"", ""5"", ""/"", ""+""]
```

The evaluation proceeds as follows:

- Push `4` onto the stack.
- Push `13` onto the stack.
- Push `5` onto the stack.
- Token is `/`: pop `5` and `13`, push `13 / 5` -> push `2` (since `/` in Python 3 with `int` results in floor division).
- Token is `+`: pop `2` and `4`, push `4 + 2` -> push `6`.
- Result: `6`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis

**Time complexity**: 

- The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of tokens in the input list. Each token is processed exactly once.

**Space complexity**: 

- The space complexity is O(n) for the stack in the worst case, when all elements are pushed before an operation occurs.

### Real-World Applications

This problem is a representation of expression evaluation, which is a common task in calculators or in interpreting expressions in programming languages. Understanding how to evaluate expressions using stack can help in developing algorithms for parsing expressions, compilers, and interpreters.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks

A common pitfall is to forget that the division operator in this problem should truncate towards zero. In Python 3, the `/` operator performs true division, and `//` performs floor division. However, the question specifies that we must truncate the result towards zero after division, which can be achieved by casting the result of `/` to `int` (assuming the arguments are integers, this correctly truncates towards zero for both positive and negative numbers).

### Problem Pattern Identification

Recognizing that a stack can effectively evaluate RPN expressions is an example of identifying the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) pattern, which is the fundamental property a stack operates on. Problems that involve reverse-order processing or have dependency on the most recent additions often lend themselves well to a stack-based approach.

Dealing with RPN expressions is a fundamental principle in computer science, often taught in courses related to compilers and interpreters. The experience of solving this problem reinforces the importance of data structures like stacks and familiarity with operation precedence, tokenization, and parsing techniques which are pervasive in solving more complex computational problems."
151,"LeetCode Problem 151 is called ""Reverse Words in a String"". Here is the problem statement:

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

The input string `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces. You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

- The input is a string that consists of words separated by spaces.
- The order of the words in the string should be reversed.
- Leading or trailing spaces in the input should be ignored in the output.
- Consecutive spaces in the input string should be reduced to a single space in the output.
- Spaces serve as the delimiter between words.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

One of the straightforward approaches to solve this problem is to:

1. Split the input string by spaces to get an array/list of words.
2. Filter out any empty strings from the list (these result from multiple spaces in the input).
3. Reverse the list of words.
4. Join the reversed list of words back into a string using a single space as the separator.

Although this approach is easy to understand and implement, it might not be the most efficient because of the several intermediate lists it creates and operations it performs.

A more efficient approach would be to:

1. Trim the leading and trailing spaces of the input string.
2. Initialize an empty list to hold the words.
3. Iterate over the string from the end and accumulate characters until a space is encountered, marking the end of a word.
4. Whenever we hit a space after reading some characters, we append the accumulated word to the list.
5. Reverse the accumulated list of words just once, and then use join to get the final string.

In terms of efficiency, this second approach avoids multiple passes over the same part of the string and operates with a minimal number of string and list operations.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Here's how you can implement the efficient version mentioned above in Python:

```python
def reverseWords(s):
    # Remove leading and trailing spaces and then split the string into words.
    words = s.strip().split()
    # Reverse the list of words.
    words.reverse()
    # Join the words back into a string with single spaces between them.
    return ' '.join(words)
```

This implementation uses Python's built-in string manipulation functions to achieve the result in a concise manner. The `strip()` method removes leading and trailing whitespace; the `split()` method by default splits the string by any whitespace and returns a list of words; `reverse()` method reverses the list of words in place; and finally, `join()` joins the words with a single space.

### Elaborate Examples:

Let's consider a couple of examples to demonstrate the solution:

Example 1:
Input: `s = ""  the sky is blue  ""`
Output: `""blue is sky the""`

After removing leading/trailing spaces and splitting, we get: `[""the"", ""sky"", ""is"", ""blue""]`
Reversing this list gives us: `[""blue"", ""is"", ""sky"", ""the""]`
Joining these words with a space gives us the final output: `""blue is sky the""`

Example 2:
Input: `s = ""  hello    world!  ""`
Output: `""world! hello""`

The same process as before results in the output after trimming and reducing spaces.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: The strip and split operations each run in linear time relative to the length of the input string (O(n)). Reversing the list of words takes O(w) where w is the number of words. The join operation also runs linearly with respect to the total number of characters in the words list. Combining all these, we get an overall time complexity of O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: Space complexity is O(w) for the list of words. This does not include the space needed for the input and output strings as they are given and required by the problem. If counting these, the space complexity would be O(n), as we would be essentially duplicating the input string.

### Real-World Applications:

The ability to manipulate strings and reorder components is essential in many real-world applications. It could be useful in text processing, formatting user input, or transforming data for display. Reverse ordering of words specifically might not be as common, but it demonstrates your ability to handle similar transformations that could be vital in formatting, coding algorithms for text editors, or processing natural language.

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

A common pitfall is not correctly handling the multiple spaces or leading/trailing spaces. It's also important to remember that strings in Python are immutable, so trying to modify a string in-place will not work, and creating extra string objects can be costly in terms of memory. Using join on a list in Python is a common and efficient trick for constructing strings from multiple components.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem can be considered a string manipulation problem, where the focus is on transforming the input string according to certain rules or patterns. Recognizing this pattern helps in quickly identifying Python string methods that can lead to a concise solution.

152,"LeetCode Problem 152 is titled ""Maximum Product Subarray."" Here's a detailed analysis of the problem:

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:
Given an integer array `nums`, the task is to find the contiguous subarray within the array that has the greatest product and return the product. A subarray is a slice from a contiguous portion of an array, which means the numbers in the subarray are consecutive in the sequence of numbers in the given array.

Key aspects of the problem:
- The array can contain both positive and negative integers, as well as zeros.
- The size of the array is at least 1 and at most 20,000.
- The integers are within the range of 32-bit signed integer.

Because the array may contain negative numbers, the product of two negative numbers becomes positive, and hence the problem cannot trivially be solved by a simple iteration looking for the highest positive subarray product. The presence of zeros further adds complexity because a zero effectively resets any product computation to 0.

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:
A brute force solution to this problem would require checking the product of all possible contiguous subarrays, which would have a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. However, this is not efficient enough for arrays that can have up to 20,000 elements.

A more efficient solution uses dynamic programming, which can solve the problem in O(n) time. The key insight is that we need to keep track of both the maximum and minimum product at each position in the array because the minimum product (which will be negative) could become the maximum if it is multiplied by a negative number.

The algorithm iterates over the array and computes max product and min product up to that point using the following state transition:
- `max_prod = max(current_number, max_prod * current_number, min_prod * current_number)`
- `min_prod = min(current_number, max_prod * current_number, min_prod * current_number)`

At each iteration, the algorithm updates the global maximum product seen so far.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

```python
def maxProduct(nums):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the max product
    # and the running maximum and minimum products.
    global_max = prev_max = prev_min = nums[0]
    
    for num in nums[1:]:  # Start iterating from the second number
        # As we are including the current number in our subarray,
        # we must decide whether to take it alone or multiply it with the previous max or min.
        # This is because a negative number could turn a min product into a max.
        candidates = (num, prev_max * num, prev_min * num)
        curr_max = max(candidates)
        curr_min = min(candidates)
        
        # Update the global max product if the current max is greater.
        global_max = max(global_max, curr_max)
        
        # Update the previous max and min for the next iteration.
        prev_max, prev_min = curr_max, curr_min

    # After processing all numbers, global_max will have the result.
    return global_max
```

Line by line analysis:
- We first initialize `global_max`, `prev_max`, and `prev_min` to the first number in the array because the max product subarray could start at any index, including the first.
- We iterate through the `nums` array starting from the second element.
- At each element, we calculate potential new products by multiplying the current element with both the previously recorded max and min products, and also consider the current element itself as a standalone product. We do this because a large positive or negative number can either enhance the max product or turn a min negative product into a max positive product.
- We then update our `global_max` whenever we find a new max product.
- We also have to maintain the state of both `prev_max` and `prev_min` to carry on the information for the next iteration.
- Once we've iterated through all elements, `global_max` will contain the maximum subarray product.

### Elaborate Examples:
Consider the array `nums = [2, 3, -2, 4]`, the function processes as follows:

- At the start, `global_max`, `prev_max`, `prev_min` are all initialized to `2`.
- Then it checks `3`, and computes:
  - `candidates = (3, 2 * 3, 2 * 3)` which is `(3, 6, 6)`. Now `prev_max = 6` and `prev_min = 3`.
- Next is `-2`, computes:
  - `candidates = (-2, 6 * -2, 3 * -2)` which is `(-2, -12, -6)`. Now `prev_max = -2` and `prev_min = -12`.
- And lastly `4`, computes:
  - `candidates = (4, -2 * 4, -12 * 4)` which is `(4, -8, -48)`. Now `prev_max = 4` and `prev_min = -8`.
- Throughout the computation, `global_max` is updated to `6` after the second iteration and remains there.

The final `global_max` is `6`, which is the product of the subarray `[2, 3]`.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: Since we iterate through the array only once, and at each step, we perform a constant number of operations, the time complexity is O(n).
- Space Complexity: We only use a fixed number of variables regardless of the input size; thus, the space complexity is O(1).

### Real-World Applications:
This problem mimics real-world scenarios where you have sequences of factors (like financial growth rates) that can be positive or negative, and you want to find the best contiguous sequence (product) that contributes to the greatest growth (or loss if negative).

### Comprehensive Overview of Common Pitfalls and Tricks:
Common pitfalls include not properly handling negative numbers and zero values. It's essential to remember that a negative number can flip the sign of the product, and a zero resets your product calculations.

### Problem Pattern Identification:
This problem falls under the dynamic programming category, particularly because it exhibits both optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems which can be solved once and reused later.

153,"LeetCode Problem 153, ""Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array,"" is a classic problem that focuses on searching and binary search in particular. Here is an extensive analysis of the problem and a detailed solution strategy.

### Extensive Problem Breakdown:

The problem statement is as follows:

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is rotated between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` after being rotated at the pivot index 3 (4 times). The task is to find the minimum element of the array without using linear search.

The array retains the order of all elements relative to the pivot, meaning no element is moved to a position before the pivot. The problem explicitly prohibits using the built-in min function or a linear search algorithm, which would have a time complexity of O(n).

### In-Depth Solution Rationale:

The problem is best approached with a binary search due to the sorted-and-then-rotated nature of the array. This is because a straightforward binary search would give us a clue about the position of the minimum element based on the comparison of the middle element with the left and right bounds.

A key observation is the following:
- If the middle element is greater than the rightmost element, the smallest value must be to the right of the middle, because the array was sorted before the rotation.
- Conversely, if the middle element is less than the rightmost element, then the smallest value must be to the left of the middle (including possibly the middle element itself).

The binary search continues on the subsection that was identified to potentially contain the smallest element until it converges to the minimum.

### Detailed Python Code Explanation:

Here's a step-by-step explanation of a typical Python solution using binary search:

```python
def findMin(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    # When the left bound is less than the right bound:
    while left < right:
        # Find the middle index.
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        # Check if the middle element is greater than the right most element.
        if nums[mid] > nums[right]:
            # Smallest element must be to the right of ""mid"".
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            # Smallest element is not greater than ""mid"" and so must be to the left of ""mid"".
            right = mid
    
    # When left and right converge, return the element at that position as it is the smallest.
    return nums[left]
```

1. `findMin(nums)` function starts with the pointers `left` and `right` set to the beginning and the end of the array, respectively.
2. The `while` loop continues as long as `left < right`.
3. The middle index is found using `mid = (left + right) // 2`. We use integer division to avoid floating-point indices.
4. A check is made to determine where to continue the search. If `nums[mid] > nums[right]`, the smallest value must be to the right of `mid`, so we update `left` to `mid + 1`.
5. Else, the smallest value is somewhere to the left of `mid`, including `mid` itself, so we update `right` to `mid`.
6. Eventually, `left` will equal `right`, and at this point, we will have found the smallest element in the array.

### Elaborate Examples:

Consider the following example:

```
nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
```

The array is rotated, and the minimum value is `1`. The binary search will proceed as follows:

```
Initial: left=0, right=4, nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Iteration 1: mid=2, nums[mid]=5, nums[right]=2 (nums[mid] > nums[right]), so search right side, left=mid+1=3
Iteration 2: left=3, right=4, nums = [1,2]
              mid=3, nums[mid]=1, nums[right]=2 (nums[mid] < nums[right]), so search left side, right=mid
Finally: left=3, right=3, nums[left]=1
```

The binary search identified `1` as the minimum value by narrowing down the search range after each comparison.

### Thorough Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. At each iteration, the search space is halved, leading to a logarithmic time complexity.

The space complexity is O(1) because the binary search is done in place, and only a constant number of integer variables is used, regardless of the input array size.

### Real-World Applications:

Finding a minimum in a rotated sorted array resembles real-world challenges such as locating a point of change or least value in a cyclically occurring dataset, which might represent economic cycles, sensor readings over time with cyclical behavior, or even finding the best time to buy/sell in financial applications.

### Common Pitfalls and Tricks:

- Remember to always compare the middle element with the rightmost, not the leftmost, since the array is rotated.
- The reason for comparing with the rightmost is that the right half of the array may not be properly sorted (because of the rotation), which is the key to identifying the location of the smallest element.

### Problem Pattern Identification:

This problem is a variation of the binary search algorithm. It falls under the search category, with a twist added by the initial rotation of the sorted array. This pattern can be reused in any binary search problem where the search space is somehow twisted or transformed but still retains some essential ordered structure.

### Extensive Links to Similar Problems:

- **LeetCode 81**: ""Search in Rotated Sorted Array II"" – Similar to LeetCode 33, but the array may contain duplicates.

Each of these problems requires applying the principles learned in Problem 153, with additional considerations for duplicates and target searching, which can slightly alter the binary search approach."

449,"LeetCode problem number 449 is ""Serialize and Deserialize BST"". This problem lies in the domain of binary tree serialization, which involves converting a Binary Search Tree (BST) into a string representation and then reconstructing the BST from that string. Here's a detailed breakdown of the problem and the common solution strategies.

### Problem Statement:

You are required to design an algorithm to serialize a binary search tree (BST) into a string and deserialize the string back into the BST. The serialization of a BST is the process of converting the BST into a string such that it can be uniquely reconstructed to its original structure. Similarly, deserialization is the process of converting this string back to the original BST.

Your algorithm should ensure that:

1. The serialized string should uniquely identify the BST.
2. Deserialization should be able to recreate the exact same BST that was serialized.

**Constraints about the BST:**

1. The number of nodes in the BST will be in the range `[0, 1000]`.
2. `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`.

### Serialization Rationale:

For serialization, we need to choose a traversal method that allows us to preserve the structure of the tree in a string format. Common traversal methods that can be used are:

- Preorder Traversal: Since a BST is defined by its root node first, followed by all nodes in its left subtree, and then all nodes in its right subtree, the preorder traversal (root-left-right) fits naturally. It also has the advantage that during deserialization, we can use the BST property to reconstruct the tree.
- Inorder Traversal: While it cannot be used alone for this purpose, as it would not allow unique reconstruction, it could be combined with another traversal method.
- Postorder Traversal: Can be used as well, but it's less intuitive than preorder as we have to start constructing the tree from the last node in the serialized string.
- Level Order Traversal: While it's also a valid method, it usually requires storing additional information (like markers for null nodes) to uniquely reconstruct the tree.

### Deserialization Rationale:

For deserialization, we need to reverse our serialization process. We'll parse the string and reconstruct the BST using the property that all values in the left subtree are less than the root, and all values in the right subtree are greater than the root.

### Solution Approach:

A common approach is to serialize the BST using preorder traversal. During serialization, we traverse the tree in a preorder fashion, and each node value is appended to the serialization string separated by some delimiter like "","".

For deserialization, we take advantage of the BST property. We maintain a range for each node (initially negative infinity to infinity) and update this range as we traverse down. While reconstructing, we ensure that the current value falls within the expected range for a valid BST node positions.

### Python Code Explanation:

Here is an example of how to implement serialization and deserialization of BST in Python:

```python
class Codec:
    def serialize(self, root):
        """"""Encodes a tree to a single string.""""""
        def preorder(node):
            return f""{node.val},{preorder(node.left)},{preorder(node.right)}"" if node else """"
        return preorder(root)

    def deserialize(self, data):
        """"""Decodes your encoded data to tree.""""""
        values = iter(int(val) for val in data.split(',') if val)
        return self.build_tree(values, float('-inf'), float('inf'))

    def build_tree(self, values, lower, upper):
        if not values:
            return None
        val = next(values)
        if val < lower or val > upper:
            return None
        root = TreeNode(val)
        root.left = self.build_tree(values, lower, val)
        root.right = self.build_tree(values, val, upper)
        return root
```

### Complexity Analysis:

- Serialization:
  - Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the BST, as we visit each node exactly once.
  - Space Complexity: O(N) to store the serialization string.

- Deserialization:
  - Time Complexity: O(N) because we visit each element in the serialized data exactly once.
  - Space Complexity: O(N) for the recursion stack in case of a skewed tree.

### Real-World Applications:

- Serialization is often used in systems where data needs to be converted into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted and then reconstructed at a later time.
- Deserialization is used to restore serialized data to its original state, such as loading saved game states, reconstructing trees from database records, or transferring structured data over a network.

### Common Pitfalls:

- Choosing a traversal method that does not allow unique reconstruction, like using inorder traversal alone.
- Failing to handle edge cases, such as an empty tree.
- Not properly dealing with delimiter or parsing errors during deserialization.

### Problem Patterns:

- This problem involves ""Tree Traversal"" and ""Design,"" often seen in problems related to data serialization and deserialization, file system representations, and network transfers.

### Related LeetCode Problems:

- ""Serialize and Deserialize N-ary Tree"" (Problem 428)
- ""Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree"" (Problem 297)
- ""Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal"" (Problem 105)

Understanding the serialization and deserialization process can greatly help in solving similar problems or any problem involving the construction or deconstruction of tree-like structures."
